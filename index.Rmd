# Abstract {-}

Most terrestrial biodiversity is found in tropical forests. Conservation of these forests is therefore a global priority, which must be reconciled with ongoing land-use and climate change. Tropical species are among the most sensitive to climate change; their persistence in the long-term is dependent on their ability to adapt *in situ* or move. A crucial unknown is the extent to which these strategies are impeded by land-use change. In this thesis, I first assess how tropical forest conversion and degradation impacts local climate. Using site-level (m-ha) temperature data, I show that tropical forest conversion to farmland results in local warming of 1.6-13.6&deg;C, but this is avoided in degraded forests and below-ground. I then explore the conservation value of degraded forests by considering temperature at finer spatial scales (mm-m), where thermal variation can allow species to avoid suboptimal temperatures. I develop an `R` package to automate processing of images from FLIR thermal cameras and to calculate metrics of thermal heterogeneity for gridded temperature data. Combining this approach with data from temperature loggers, I compare thermal buffering capacity in the understorey of selectively logged and unlogged forests on Borneo. I find that 9-12 years after intensive selective logging the potential for thermal buffering is similar in logged and unlogged forests. Finally, I consider that even where thermal buffering is feasible, range shifts may be necessary for long-term persistence. Combining global forest cover and climate datasets, I find that 62% of global tropical forest area fails to connect to analogous future climates. In 12 years, connectivity to future climate analogues decreased in 27% of tropical forest area, with losses accelerating as the area of forest loss increased. Put together, my findings suggest that degraded forests can buffer species from climate change, but thermal buffering is severely compromised with conversion to non-forest habitats. To enhance climate resilience of tropical forests there is a need to protect remaining tropical forests and to strategically plan reforestation and forest restoration with climate gradients and connectivity in mind.

# Acknowledgements {-}

A huge thanks first of all to both of my supervisors: Dr David Edwards and Prof Jane Hill. Your guidance throughout has been invaluable.

Thanks to the Natural Environment Research Council for funding this project, and to the ACCE (Adapting to the Challenges of a Changing Environment) Doctoral Training Partnership for providing so many great opportunities. A particular thanks to Dr Venelina Koleva for dealing with all my awkward requests.

Thanks to my local collaborator, Dr Suzan Benedick, for supporting my work in the field. Thanks to Sabah Biodiversity Council, Danum Valley Wildlife Management Committee, the South East Asia Rainforest Research Partnership, Yayasan Sabah and the Sabah Wildlife Department for permitting me to work in Sabah and the Danum Valley Conservation Area. For facilitating my fieldwork I thank all the staff at Danum Valley Research Centre, particularly the logistical support of Adrian Karolus and Datuk Dr Glen Reynolds. For field assistance I thank: Azlin Bin Sailim, Ahmad Bin Jelling, Deddy Nurdin, Jessica Olid and Chloe Walker-Trivett. 

Throughout my PhD I was humbled to receive data, advice and code freely from various different researchers (named in the relevant chapters). Numerous people within my Universities of Sheffield and York provided helpful discussions and feedback: my project supporter, Prof Rob Freckleton, the J2 lab, and everyone from Conservation Bites. Felix Lim and Simon Mills must get a special mention for joining me on various rambling thought processes.

Many people (and some animals!) supported me on a personal level, without which I would have probably been in a perpetual, chocolate-laden slump. Thanks to the Mynas for listening to my rants and keeping the snack table topped up. Thanks to Cindy Cosset and Chloe Walker-Trivett for general laughs and amazing food. Thanks to my brother, Thomas, for being a source of entertainment and for helping me with mathsy stuff, and to my Grandparents -- Charles and Marylyn Marchington -- for remaining interested in the strange activities of your wayward granddaughter.

To my Mum -- where to start! Thanks for always being there, for always being supportive, and for being a total inspiration. Whenever I think I can't do something, I think of you. Not just your words of encouragement, but the example you live by every day: turning your hand to anything and never giving up.

To Kieran -- you've been an anchor throughout my PhD and I can't really do that justice here. I'm so grateful for everything: the pep talks, the silliness, the enforced relaxing, the emergency mug cakes...so many things! Now it's your turn, and I hope I can return the favour. Noms, fol and abductions.  

I dedicate my PhD to Dr Aisha Coggan. I wish you were here to finish this with me.
