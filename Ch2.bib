	abstract = {The conversion of natural forest to oil palm plantation is a major current threat to the conservation of biodiversity in South East Asia. Most animal taxa decrease in both species richness and abundance on conversion of forest to oil palm, and there is usually a severe loss of forest species. The extent of loss varies significantly across both different taxa and different microhabitats within the oil palm habitat. The principal driver of this loss in diversity is probably the biological and physical simplification of the habitat, but there is little direct evidence for this. The conservation of forest species requires the preservation of large reserves of intact forest, but we must not lose sight of the importance of conserving biodiversity and ecosystem processes within the oil palm habitat itself. We urgently need to carry out research that will establish whether maintaining diversity supports economically and ecologically important processes. There is some evidence that both landscape and local complexity can have positive impacts on biodiversity in the oil palm habitat. By intelligent manipulation of habitat complexity, it could be possible to enhance not only the number of species that can live in oil palm plantations but also their contribution to the healthy functioning of this exceptionally important and widespread landscape.},

	abstract = {Southeast Asia is a hotspot of imperilled biodiversity, owing to extensive logging and forest conversion to oil palm agriculture. The degraded forests that remain after multiple rounds of intensive logging are often assumed to be of little conservation value; consequently, there has been no concerted effort to prevent them from being converted to oil palm. However, no study has quantified the biodiversity of repeatedly logged forests. We compare the species richness and composition of birds and dung beetles within unlogged (primary), once-logged and twice-logged forests in Sabah, Borneo. Logging had little effect on the overall richness of birds. Dung beetle richness declined following once-logging but did not decline further after twice-logging. The species composition of bird and dung beetle communities was altered, particularly after the second logging rotation, but globally imperilled bird species (IUCN Red List) did not decline further after twice-logging. Remarkably, over 75 per cent of bird and dung beetle species found in unlogged forest persisted within twice-logged forest. Although twice-logged forests have less biological value than primary and once-logged forests, they clearly provide important habitat for numerous bird and dung beetle species. Preventing these degraded forests from being converted to oil palm should be a priority of policy-makers and conservationists.},

Whether these new agricultural lands replace forests, degraded forests, or grasslands greatly influences the environmental consequences of expansion. Although the general pattern is known, there still is no definitive quantification of these land-cover changes. Here we analyze the rich, pan-tropical database of classified Landsat scenes created by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations to examine pathways of agricultural expansion across the major tropical forest regions in the 1980s and 1990s and use this information to highlight the future land conversions that probably will be needed to meet mounting demand for agricultural products. Across the tropics, we find that between 1980 and 2000 more than 55\% of new agricultural land came at the expense of intact forests, and another 28\% came from disturbed forests. This study underscores the potential consequences of unabated agricultural expansion for forest conservation and carbon emissions.},

Yet the final descent to extinction is often driven by synergistic processes (amplifying feedbacks) that can be disconnected from the original cause of decline. We review recent observational, experimental and meta-analytic work which together show that owing to interacting and self-reinforcing processes, estimates of extinction risk for most species are more severe than previously recognised. As such, conservation actions which only target single-threat drivers risk being inadequate because of the cascading effects caused by unmanaged synergies. Future work should focus on how climate change will interact with and accelerate ongoing threats to biodiversity, such as habitat degradation, overexploitation and invasive species.},

	abstract = {The ranges of plants and animals are moving in response to recent changes in climate. As temperatures rise, ecosystems with ‘nowhere to go’, such as mountains, are considered to be more threatened. However, species survival may depend as much on keeping pace with moving climates as the climate’s ultimate persistence. Here we present a new index of the velocity of temperature change (km yr-1), derived from spatial gradients (°C km-1) and multimodel ensemble forecasts of rates of temperature increase (°C yr-1) in the twenty-first century. This index represents the instantaneous local velocity along Earth’s surface needed to maintain constant temperatures, and has a global mean of 0.42 km yr-1 (A1B emission scenario). Owing to topographic effects, the velocity of temperature change is lowest in mountainous biomes such as tropical and subtropical coniferous forests (0.08 km yr-1), temperate coniferous forest, and montane grasslands. Velocities are highest in flooded grasslands (1.26 km yr-1), mangroves and deserts. High velocities suggest that the climates of only 8\% of global protected areas have residence times exceeding 100 years. Small protected areas exacerbate the problem in Mediterranean-type and temperate coniferous forest biomes. Large protected areas may mitigate the problem in desert biomes. These results indicate management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss from climate change. Montane landscapes may effectively shelter many species into the next century. Elsewhere, reduced emissions, a much expanded network of protected areas, or efforts to increase species movement may be necessary.},

Thermal tolerance data suggests that tropical species may respond to warming temperatures even more strongly than temperate-zone species, but this prediction has yet to be tested. We addressed this data gap by conducting resurveys to measure distributional responses to temperature increases in the elevational limits of the avifaunas of two geographically and faunally independent New Guinean mountains, Mt. Karimui and Karkar Island, 47 and 44 y after they were originally surveyed. Although species richness is roughly five times greater on mainland Mt. Karimui than oceanic Karkar Island, distributional shifts at both sites were similar: upslope shifts averaged 113 m (Mt. Karimui) and 152 m (Karkar Island) for upper limits and 95 m (Mt. Karimui) and 123 m (Karkar Island) for lower limits. We incorporated these results into a metaanalysis to compare distributional responses of tropical species with those of temperate-zone species, finding that average upslope shifts in tropical montane species match local temperature increases significantly more closely than in temperate-zone montane species. That tropical species appear to be strong responders has global conservation implications and provides empirical support to hitherto untested models that predict widespread extinctions in upper-elevation tropical endemics with small ranges.},

Here we examine the extent to which these forests sustain timber production, retain species, and conserve carbon stocks. We then describe some improvements in tropical forestry and how their implementation can be promoted.  A simple meta-analysis based on {\textgreater}100 publications revealed substantial variability but that: timber yields decline by about 46\% after the first harvest but are subsequently sustained at that level; 76\% of carbon is retained in once-logged forests; and, 85–100\% of species of mammals, birds, invertebrates, and plants remain after logging. Timber stocks will not regain primary-forest levels within current harvest cycles, but yields increase if collateral damage is reduced and silvicultural treatments are applied.  Given that selectively logged forests retain substantial biodiversity, carbon, and timber stocks, this “middle way” between deforestation and total protection deserves more attention from researchers, conservation organizations, and policy-makers. Improvements in forest management are now likely if synergies are enhanced among initiatives to retain forest carbon stocks (REDD+), assure the legality of forest products, certify responsible management, and devolve control over forests to empowered local communities.},

The rapid conversion of tropical forests for agriculture, timber production and other uses has generated vast, human-dominated landscapes with potentially dire consequences for tropical biodiversity. Today, few truly undisturbed tropical forests exist, whereas those degraded by repeated logging and fires, as well as secondary and plantation forests, are rapidly expanding. Here we provide a global assessment of the impact of disturbance and land conversion on biodiversity in tropical forests using a meta-analysis of 138 studies. We analysed 2,220 pairwise comparisons of biodiversity values in primary forests (with little or no human disturbance) and disturbed forests. We found that biodiversity values were substantially lower in degraded forests, but that this varied considerably by geographic region, taxonomic group, ecological metric and disturbance type. Even after partly accounting for confounding colonization and succession effects due to the composition of surrounding habitats, isolation and time since disturbance, we find that most forms of forest degradation have an overwhelmingly detrimental effect on tropical biodiversity. Our results clearly indicate that when it comes to maintaining tropical biodiversity, there is no substitute for primary forests.},

	abstract = {Land use has generally been considered a local environmental issue, but it is becoming a force of global importance. Worldwide changes to forests, farmlands, waterways, and air are being driven by the need to provide food, fiber, water, and shelter to more than six billion people. Global croplands, pastures, plantations, and urban areas have expanded in recent decades, accompanied by large increases in energy, water, and fertilizer consumption, along with considerable losses of biodiversity. Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases. We face the challenge of managing trade-offs between immediate human needs and maintaining the capacity of the biosphere to provide goods and services in the long term.},

	abstract = {The authors compared tropical rain forest canopy structure and tree species composition in two forests southeast of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia: a primary forest and a regenerating forest that was selectively logged in 1958. For each of the forests, the study plots were set out and all trees of ≥1 cm in DBH (diameter at breast height) were mapped and measured. Canopy heights were measured in the two study plots based upon aerial triangulation using aerial photographs taken over the forests in 1997. Using this data, digital elevation models of the canopy were then constructed. The mean canopy height was greater in the primary forest (27.4 m versus 24.8 m), as was the variance in height and the number of emergent canopy trees \&gt;40 m height. The mean canopy surface area in the primary forest was nearly 1.5 times the value in the regenerating forest, and the mean crown size of canopy layer trees in the primary forest was more than twice that in the regenerating forest. The species diversity index (Fisher’s α) differed for the two forests, indicating that tree species diversity had been affected by the logging. Both forests had the same five families with the greatest stem density (stems ha−1), but the 50 most abundant species, in terms of both stem density and basal area, differed greatly between the two forests. Stem densities and basal areas were similar, but the number of stems per hectare and the basal areas of medium-sized trees (10–30 cm in DBH) were distinctly higher in the regenerating forest. These results suggest that average basal area and stem density in the regenerating forest that had been selectively logged 41 years earlier had recovered to levels similar to those in the primary forest; however, the regenerating forest had a more monotonic canopy structure comprised of medium-sized trees growing at high density. These findings also imply that structural development takes a long time to manifest in a regenerating forest as a result of the time taken for the development of emergent and canopy trees and the formation of gaps; structural development might also be delayed by the high density of medium-sized trees in the canopy layer.},

	abstract = {The impact of anthropogenic climate change on terrestrial organisms is often predicted to increase with latitude, in parallel with the rate of warming. Yet the biological impact of rising temperatures also depends on the physiological sensitivity of organisms to temperature change. We integrate empirical fitness curves describing the thermal tolerance of terrestrial insects from around the world with the projected geographic distribution of climate change for the next century to estimate the direct impact of warming on insect fitness across latitude. The results show that warming in the tropics, although relatively small in magnitude, is likely to have the most deleterious consequences because tropical insects are relatively sensitive to temperature change and are currently living very close to their optimal temperature. In contrast, species at higher latitudes have broader thermal tolerance and are living in climates that are currently cooler than their physiological optima, so that warming may even enhance their fitness. Available thermal tolerance data for several vertebrate taxa exhibit similar patterns, suggesting that these results are general for terrestrial ectotherms. Our analyses imply that, in the absence of ameliorating factors such as migration and adaptation, the greatest extinction risks from global warming may be in the tropics, where biological diversity is also greatest.},

	abstract = {A high world demand for crude palm oil has caused a reduction in the area of Indonesia’s tropical rainforests over the past several decades. Our hypothesis is that the expansion of the area devoted to oil palm plantations at the expense of primary and secondary tropical rainforests will increase the local surface temperature. While similar studies of other crops have been reported, this is the first time this particular hypothesis has been investigated and reported using the remote sensing methods described in this paper. In this study, we used remotely sensed data to quantify land use changes from tropical rainforests to oil palm plantations, calculated the surface temperature from thermal infrared data supplied by band 6 of the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), examined the correlations of surface temperature to foliage cover, and conducted field work to verify the results obtained using the remotely sensed data. For this study, we used a new spectral index, Principal Polar Spectral Greenness (PPSG), that is potentially more sensitive than other index to small changes in foliage cover at high cover levels. The outcome of satellite image processing is only 0.2 °C different from direct temperature measurement in the field. Our study indicated that less density of the closed-canopy composition of oil palm trees resulted in higher surface temperature.},

	abstract = {The rapid expansion of oil palm cultivation and corresponding deforestation has invoked widespread concern for biodiversity in Southeast Asia and throughout the tropics. However, no study explicitly addresses how habitat characteristics change when (1) forest is converted to oil palm, or (2) through the dynamic 25–30-year oil palm lifecycle. These two questions are fundamental to understanding how biodiversity will be impacted by oil palm development.

Our results from a chronosequence study on microclimate and vegetation structure in oil palm plantations surrounding the Pasoh Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia, show dramatic habitat changes when forest is converted to oil palm. However, they also reveal substantial habitat heterogeneity throughout the plantation lifecycle. Oil palm plantations are created by clear-cutting forests and then terracing the land. This reduces the 25 m-tall forest canopy to bare ground with a harsh microclimate. Eight-year-old oil palm plantations had 4 m open-canopies; 22-year-old plantations had 13 m closed-canopies. Old plantations had significantly more buffered microclimates than young plantations. Understory vegetation was twice as tall in young plantations, but leaf litter depth and total epiphyte abundance were double in old plantations. Nonetheless, leaf litter coverage was patchy throughout the oil palm life cycle due to the stacking of all palm fronds. Overall, oil palm plantations were substantially hotter (+2.84 °C) and drier (+0.80 hPa vapor pressure deficit), than forests during diurnal hours. However, there were no nocturnal microclimate differences between forests and plantations. Finally, we describe how the variable retention of old palm trees during crop rotation can retain habitat features and maintain more stable microclimate conditions than clear-cutting senescent plantations. We discuss the implications of habitat changes for biodiversity and introduce three methods to utilize temporal habitat heterogeneity to enhance the quality of the oil palm landscape matrix.},

	abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) are key for conserving rainforest species, but many PAs are becoming increasingly isolated within agricultural landscapes, which may have detrimental consequences for the forest biota they contain. We examined the vulnerability of PA networks to climate change by examining connectivity of PAs along elevation gradients. We used the PA network on Borneo as a model system, and examined changes in the spatial distribution of climate conditions in future. A large proportion of PAs will not contain analogous climates in future (based on temperature projections for 2061–2080), potentially requiring organisms to move to cooler PAs at higher elevation, if they are to track climate changes. For the highest warming scenario (RCP8.5), few (11–12.5\%; 27–30/240) PAs were sufficiently topographically diverse for analogous climate conditions (present-day equivalent or cooler) to remain in situ. For the remaining 87.5–89\% (210–213/240) of PAs, which were often situated at low elevation, analogous climate will only be available in higher elevation PAs. However, over half (60–82\%) of all PAs on Borneo are too isolated for poor dispersers (\&lt;1 km per generation) to reach cooler PAs, because there is a lack of connecting forest habitat. Even under the lowest warming scenario (RCP2.6), analogous climate conditions will disappear from 61\% (146/240) of PAs, and a large proportion of these are too isolated for poor dispersers to reach cooler PAs. Our results suggest that low elevation PAs are particularly vulnerable to climate change, and management to improve linkage of PAs along elevation gradients should be a conservation priority.},

	abstract = {Recent mass mortalities of bats, birds and even humans highlight the substantial threats that rising global temperatures pose for endotherms. Although less dramatic, sublethal fitness costs of high temperatures may be considerable and result in changing population demographics. Endothermic animals exposed to high environmental temperatures can adjust their behaviour (e.g. reducing activity) or physiology (e.g. elevating rates of evaporative water loss) to maintain body temperatures within tolerable limits. The fitness consequences of these adjustments, in terms of the ability to balance water and energy budgets and therefore maintain body condition, are poorly known. We investigated the effects of daily maximum temperature on foraging and thermoregulatory behaviour as well as maintenance of body condition in a wild, habituated population of Southern Pied Babblers Turdoides bicolor. These birds inhabit a hot, arid area of southern Africa where they commonly experience environmental temperatures exceeding optimal body temperatures. Repeated measurements of individual behaviour and body mass were taken across days varying in maximum air temperature. Contrary to expectations, foraging effort was unaffected by daily maximum temperature. Foraging efficiency, however, was lower on hotter days and this was reflected in a drop in body mass on hotter days. When maximum air temperatures exceeded 35.5 °C, individuals no longer gained sufficient weight to counter typical overnight weight loss. This reduction in foraging efficiency is likely driven, in part, by a trade-off with the need to engage in heat-dissipation behaviours. When we controlled for temperature, individuals that actively dissipated heat while continuing to forage experienced a dramatic decrease in their foraging efficiency. This study demonstrates the value of investigations of temperature-dependent behaviour in the context of impacts on body condition, and suggests that increasingly high temperatures will have negative implications for the fitness of these arid-zone birds.},

The goal of this study was to assess the importance of these factors in limiting forest regeneration in abandoned pastures. Seed rain of animal dispersed species decreased dramatically in the pasture {\textgreater}5 m from the forest/pasture edge; fewer wind dispersed seeds fell in the pasture than in the forest, but the difference was much less than for animal dispersed seeds. Percent seed germination of most species studied was similar in the forest and in pasture with grasses; seed germination was lower during the dry season in areas of pasture cleared of grasses. Air temperature, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and photon flux density (PFD) were much higher in the pasture than in the forest at 1 m above the ground. VPD and PFD at ground level and soil temperature were similar in the pasture and the forest, indicating that pasture grasses strongly modify microclimatic conditions near the soil surface. The lowest gravimetric water content recorded in the pasture during the dry season was 0.5 and leaf relative water contents of the two species measured in the forest and pasture were identical, suggesting that plants in the pasture were not water stressed. Levels of most soil nutrients were lower in the pasture as compared to the forest; however, aboveground and root biomass for seedlings grown in pasture and forest soils did not differ significantly. Although a number of factors impede forest recovery in abandoned pastures, these results suggest that the most important limitation is lack of seed dispersal.},

Two patterns of seasonal fluctuations characterized by a single maximum population density on the one hand and multiple peak populations on the other hand were shown by the mite groups in the forest and cassava plots. Unlike most mite groups whose patterns of fluctuation were similar in the forest and cassava plots, Haplozetes sp., Carabodes sp., Oppia sp., Tectocepheus sp., and Parasitidae were reported to have reacted to the difference in environmental attributes between the forest and the cassava plots by exhibiting different fluctuation patterns between the two plots.

To do this, soil surface CO2–C flux was measured monthly in a tropical cloud forest, a corn–potato–corn rotation plot and a grassland using the static chamber method. Average CO2 flux varied from 0.54 to 2.21 g C m−2 day−1 in the tropical cloud forest, 0.43 to 3.07 g C m−2 day−1 in the corn–potato–corn rotation and 1.51 to 4.87 g C m−2 day−1 in the grassland. Soil surface CO2–C flux increased significantly with the change from tropical cloud forest to managed ecosystems. The highest CO2 flux occurred in summer, with peaks in September 2003 for tropical cloud forest and grassland sites and in July 2003 and May 2004 for corn–potato–corn rotation. In autumn, soil surface CO2–C flux started to decrease, with the lowest flux occurring in winter. For the entire data set, there was a weak positive correlation between soil surface CO2–C flux and soil temperature (R2 = 0.12, P \&lt; 0.0001) and a weak negative correlation between soil surface CO2–C flux and air-filled pore space (R2 = 0.17, P \&lt; 0.0001). The results indicate that tropical cloud forest, corn–potato–corn rotation, and grassland growing under the same climatic and soil conditions have different soil surface CO2–C flux rates.},

	abstract = {The regeneration of many tropical trees is threatened by forest fragmentation because it produces major physical, biological and ecological changes that limit seed germination and seedling establishment. We analyzed the regenerative potential of an old growth forest tree species—Ampelocera hottlei (Ulmaceae)—in three contrasting habitats located in the Lacandona rain forest, southeastern Mexico: continuous forest, fragments occupied by black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) and fragments unoccupied by howlers. We tested if germination of A. hottlei seeds among habitats was affected by understory temperature, light incidence and ingestion by A. pigra. We compared seedling survival and relative growth rate in height (RGRH) for 20 d among habitats and between ingested and control seeds (from mature fruits). Germination was higher in continuous forest than in fragments (occupied or not), with higher germination rates for ingested seeds in fragments. Temperature and light incidence were lower in continuous forest than in fragments. Germination decreased with increasing temperature and light incidence with this relationship being significantly higher for ingested seeds. Seedling survival was higher in continuous forest than in fragments, whereas RGRH did not differ among habitats. In addition, survival and RGRH were higher in seedlings originating from ingested seeds. Overall, our results suggest that the populations of A. hottlei can be limited in fragments where changes in the understory physical environment and the extirpation of A. pigra will likely have deleterious consequences for the regeneration of A. hottlei and possibly for other tree species, ultimately affecting forest composition and structure.

We first investigated seed viability and response of seed germination to temperature, humidity, vapour pressure deficit (VPD), and light, under controlled growth chamber conditions. We recorded these environmental conditions within a seasonal tropical forest where this species is common and then conducted seed germination trials in various seral stages. In growth chambers, with constant water supply, highest germination percentages were at the highest temperature and lowest VPD levels. In the field, germination was less than 1\%. Because of high temperatures and VPD within early seral stages, efforts to re-introduce A. bracteata into forests {\textless}20 years old are not likely to be successful.},

	abstract = {Fires are one of the main causes of forest loss in the tropics. Understanding the dynamic edge effects is critical for managing fires and protecting forests. We measured and analysed trends in microclimatic conditions (air temperature, relative humidity and vapour pressure deficit) over 7 months along three transects extending from core savanna areas to core forest areas. We tested two hypotheses: (i) that the forest edge is subject to microclimatic edge effects, and (ii) that the depth of these edge effects increases during dry periods. Sharp changes in each microclimatic variable were consistently observed between savanna and forest throughout the study period. Microclimatic transitions took place within 5 m outside the forest boundary. Drought levels increased homogenously throughout the forest and were not disproportionately severe in the vicinity of the forest edge. We suggest that these results were related to the fact that the studied period was abnormally humid due to a La Niña episode, and that under such conditions the vulnerability of the forest edge to savanna fires is relatively low. Relatively wet conditions in the savanna close to the forest edge may promote forest expansion by limiting fire spread. Prescribed fires during humid years could reduce fuel loads in savanna without affecting the forest edge, which would prevent fires during the dry years associated with El Niño episodes from having severe impacts.},

	abstract = {A functional group model of ant community composition has been widely used in Australia to analyse biogeographical patterns of ant community structure and the responses of ant communities to disturbance. The model has provided valuable support to the widespread use of ant communities as bioindicators of ecological change. However, the model was developed from studies of arid-zone faunas, and its applicability to the World Heritage rainforests of Queensland's humid tropics has not yet been validated. Here we test predictions based on the functional group model for ant communities in Queensland's humid rainforests, by documenting ant community composition and its responses to disturbance on the Atherton Tablelands. Five sites were studied, comprising two relatively undisturbed reference sites representing contrasting rainforest types, and three previously cleared sites, two of which were undergoing revegetation. A variety of sampling techniques were employed, including pitfall trapping, litter extractions, baiting, and general searching. A total of 50 ant species from 29 genera were collected. Site species richness was highest at the reference sites, and lowest at the unvegetated disturbed site, and overall was negatively related to mean ground temperature. As predicted by the functional group model, behaviorally dominant dolichoderines were uncommon or absent at the reference sites, and the most common ants were Generalized myrmicines and Opportunists. Also as predicted, habitat disturbance favored Opportunists, and, as the disturbance involved canopy clearance, this led to colonization by Iridomyrmex and other Dominant dolichoderines. Opportunists represented about 40\% of total ants in traps at the reference sites, compared with 80–95\% at the disturbed sites. Except one species, Tropical Climate Specialists and Specialist Predators were absent from disturbed sites. In conclusion, patterns of ant composition in relation to disturbance on the Atherton Tablelands conform to the functional group model that has been widely applied to ant faunas elsewhere in Australia. The model may therefore play an important role in the use of ants as bioindicators of ecological change in the World Heritage rainforests of this region.},

	abstract = {Tropical landscapes are dominated by agroecosystems, but the potential value of agroecosystems for the survival of species is often overlooked. In agroecosystems, species conservation is especially important when functional groups such as predators are affected. In Central Sulawesi, we sampled arthropods on cocoa in a gradient of land-use intensity from extensively used forest gardens to intensively used agroforestry systems. The abundance and diversity of all arthropods did not correlate with land-use intensity, so human impact was not followed by high species losses. However, the number of species and abundance of the phytophagous arthropods increased and that of the entomophagous arthropods decreased with land-use intensity. The reduced predator–prey ratio in intensified systems can be related to their reduced species richness of shade trees and the changed microclimate (increased temperature, decreased humidity and canopy cover). In conclusion, transformation of traditional into intensified agroforestry systems had a great impact on arthropod community structure on cocoa. Since predator–prey ratios decreased with increasing land-use intensity, local farmers should have least pest problems in the traditionally diversified agroforestry systems.},

To test whether the successional understorey environment changes predictably and is shaped by the structure and seasonality of tropical dry forests, we estimated basal area and vegetation cover, and measured understorey temperature, light and moisture conditions, in 17 plots forming a 60-y chronosequence and a mature forest. Light and air and soil temperature decreased with time (75−15\% of open-sky radiation, 31.7−29.3 °C, and +2.5 °C to −0.5 °C relative to ambient, respectively), whereas relative humidity increased (67−74\%). Soil water availability increased with early-successional development (−45 to −1 kPa) but decreased afterwards (to −18 kPa). The first axis of a PCA of the rainy-season environment explained 60\% of the variation and was strongly related to air temperature and relative humidity. During tropical dry-forest succession, such factors may be more important than light, the reduction in which is not extreme compared with taller and more vertically stratified wet forests. Seasonality significantly affected the successional environmental gradients, which were marked mainly during the wet season. Environmental heterogeneity was higher in the wet than in the dry season, and larger for resources (light and water) than for conditions (temperature and humidity). The wet-season increase in environmental heterogeneity potentially creates differential growing scenarios; the environmental harshness of the dry season would mostly challenge seedling survival.},

Converting tropical forests to pastures often drastically increases the abundance of exotic earthworm populations such as Pontoscolex corethrurus. We initiated this study to examine the influence of exotic earthworms on the decomposition of plant leaves and roots in a tropical pasture and a wet forest of Puerto Rico. We employed two treatments: control with natural earthworm population, and earthworm reduction using an electroshocking technique. Decomposition rates of plant leaves on the ground surface and root materials within the surface mineral soil were estimated using a litterbag technique. To understand the role that exotic earthworms play in altering plant litter decomposition, we also compared soil CO2 evolution rates, soil microbial biomass, and physical and chemical soil properties between the controls and earthworm-reduced plots during a one-year period. Earthworm populations in the electroshocked enclosures were reduced by 85\% and 87\% as compared with pasture and forest controls by the end of the experiment. Earthworm reduction significantly decreased the annual decay rates of plant leaves but had no effects on those of plant roots in both pasture and forest sites. Although the control plots had less mass remaining on every litterbag collecting date, significant treatment effects on leaf decomposition occurred only after 240 d in both sites. The decay rates were greater when organic materials had low carbon to nitrogen or phosphorus ratios. Soil respiration was also decreased in the earthworm-reduced plots. In contrast, soil microbial biomass C was not affected by earthworm reduction. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the two treatments in soil bulk density, moisture content, pH, or temperature at either site. Our results suggest that exotic earthworms may accelerate leaf litter decomposition by elevating rates of litter consumption/digestion or microbial activity, rather than by improving soil physical/chemical conditions or altering microbial biomass.},

	abstract = {The environmental and vegetation shifts associated with logging disturbance and secondary succession in Tropical Montane Cloud Forests have been studied in detail, however little is known about the consequences that these changes have for the soil system. The present study was undertaken to determine the impact of selective logging and subsequent secondary succession on soil microenvironmental conditions, leaf litter quality and quantity, soil nutrient concentration and soil and litter macroinvertebrate community composition. The study was carried out in three successional chronosequences, two recently logged sites and two pristine tropical mountain cloud forest sites in Oaxaca, Mexico. Results showed that selective harvesting of Quercus spp. trees caused an increase in soil temperature of ca. 4 °C that is not completely reversed after 100 years of succession. During 100 years of secondary succession litter diversity increased and soil organic matter accumulated (16.4\% increase in total C). The availability of cations (Ca, Mg, Na, and K) in the topsoil decreased by more than 50\% as a result of logging, and only Mg increased again between 75 and 100 years after disturbance.

Pristine cloud forests sustain a diverse litter and soil macroinvertebrate community, but its composition and diversity was negatively affected by logging. The effect of Quercus harvesting activities on the litter community was apparent within 2 months of disturbance (total abundance declined by ca. 65\%, higher taxa richness by ca. 10\% and diversity by ca. 35\%). For the soil community there was a time-lag in the effect of logging. Two months after disturbance there was no significant effect on the soil community but 15 years after abandonment, total macroinvertebrate abundance in the soil was ca. 80\% lower and higher taxa richness ca. 30\% lower compared to undisturbed sites. Full recovery of the macroinvertebrate community composition appeared to take more than 100 years both in the litter and soil. Reduced abundances of Coleoptera and Enchytraeidae were apparent even after 100 years of succession. The endemic earthworm Ramiellona wilsoni was found almost exclusively in the pristine forests and therefore its abundance could be used as a sensitive indicator of disturbance in these forests.},

We examined whether the amount and quality of foliar damage on the pioneer herbs Heliconia latispatha and Heliconia collinsiana are distinct on road edges and secondary riparian vegetation compared with natural gaps in continuous forest (controls) in Mexico. We also investigated some physical and biological mechanisms that may jointly explain such differences. The overall insect damage in H. latispatha was similar between road edges and natural forest gaps (8.0\% vs. 7.2\% of leaf area). Damage by caterpillars, however, decreased from 4.2 percent in forest gaps to 0.5 percent on road edges, whereas damage by leaf-cutting ants increased from 0 to 5.8 percent. In secondary riparian vegetation, where none of the leaves sampled were attacked by ants, overall herbivore damage in H. collinsiana was less than half that observed in forest gaps (3.0\% vs. 6.7\%), and driven mainly by differences in caterpillar damage (2.5\% vs. 6.2\%). By contrast, attack by leaf fungal pathogens was two to three times greater in both human-disturbed habitats than in gaps (8.2–9.6\% vs. 3.7–4.2\%). Potential mechanisms underlying these differences involved human-induced shifts in air and soil temperature driven by greater light availability, as well as changes in relative humidity, leaf toughness, foliar condensed tannins, and local abundance of herbivores. Our results indicate that human disturbance alters insect herbivory and may increase proliferation of leaf disease. Abstract in Spanish is available in the online version of this article.},

Here, the relationships between leaf area index and five climate variables – air temperature, relative humidity, vapour pressure deficit, specific humidity and soil temperature – are investigated across a range of land use types in Borneo, including primary tropical forest, logged forest and oil palm plantation. Strong correlations with the leaf area index are found for the mean daily maximum air and soil temperatures, the mean daily maximum vapour pressure deficit and the mean daily minimum relative humidity. Air beneath canopies with high leaf area index is cooler and has higher relative humidity during the day. Forest microclimate is also found to be less variable for sites with higher leaf area indices. Primary forest is found to be up to 2.5 °C cooler than logged forest and up to 6.5 °C cooler than oil palm plantations.

	abstract = {The main focus of this study was to evaluate the effects of soil moisture and temperature on temporal variation of N2O, CO2 and CH4 soil-atmosphere exchange at a primary seasonal tropical rainforest (PF) site in Southwest China and to compare these fluxes with fluxes from a secondary forest (SF) and a rubber plantation (RP) site. Agroforestry systems, such as rubber plantations, are increasingly replacing primary and secondary forest systems in tropical Southwest China and thus effect the N2O emission in these regions on a landscape level. The mean N2O emission at site PF was 6.0 ± 0.1 SE μg N m−2 h−1. Fluxes of N2O increased from {\textless}5 μg N m−2 h−1 during dry season conditions to up to 24.5 μg N m−2 h−1 with re-wetting of the soil by the onset of first rainfall events. Comparable fluxes of N2O were measured in the SF and RP sites, where mean N2O emissions were 7.3 ± 0.7 SE μg N m−2 h−1 and 4.1 ± 0.5 SE μg N m−2 h−1, respectively. The dependency of N2O fluxes on soil moisture levels was demonstrated in a watering experiment, however, artificial rainfall only influenced the timing of N2O emission peaks, not the total amount of N2O emitted. For all sites, significant positive correlations existed between N2O emissions and both soil moisture and soil temperature. Mean CH4 uptake rates were highest at the PF site (−29.5 ± 0.3 SE μg C m−2 h−1), slightly lower at the SF site (−25.6 ± 1.3 SE μg C m−2 h−1) and lowest for the RP site (−5.7 ± 0.5 SE μg C m−2 h−1). At all sites, CH4 uptake rates were negatively correlated with soil moisture, which was also reflected in the lower uptake rates measured in the watering experiment. In contrast to N2O emissions, CH4 uptake did not significantly correlate with soil temperature at the SF and RP sites, and only weakly correlated at the PF site. Over the 2 month measurement period, CO2 emissions at the PF site increased significantly from 50 mg C m−2 h−1 up to 100 mg C m−2 h−1 (mean value 68.8 ± 0.8 SE mg C m−2 h−1), whereas CO2 emissions at the SF and RP site where quite stable and varied only slightly around mean values of 38.0 ± 1.8 SE mg C m−2 h−1 (SF) and 34.9 ± 1.1 SE mg C m−2 h−1 (RP). A dependency of soil CO2 emissions on changes in soil water content could be demonstrated for all sites, thus, the watering experiment revealed significantly higher CO2 emissions as compared to control chambers. Correlation of CO2 emissions with soil temperature was significant at the PF site, but weak at the SF and not evident at the RP site. Even though we demonstrated that N and C trace gas fluxes significantly varied on subdaily and daily scales, weekly measurements would be sufficient if only the sink/ source strength of non-managed tropical forest sites needs to be identified.},

	abstract = {We experimentally manipulated forest floor litter to investigate the influence of litter quality and quantity on soil properties over the short-term (weeks to months) in a wet tropical forest in NE Costa Rica. The study included old growth forest on high fertility soils, old growth forest on low fertility soils, and secondary forest on intermediate fertility soils. Forest floor litter was removed from a 16 m2 area and added to an adjacent 4 m2 area in March 2003, resulting in a one to four-fold increase in the annual litter input to the forest floor. We created three addition, three removal and three control plots per forest type. We measured treatment effects on variation in soil moisture, temperature, pH, and Bray-1 P (plant available) over a 5-month period that captured the dry-wet season transition. Litter manipulation had no effect on any of the soil properties measured during the 5-month study period. Significant variability through time and a similar temporal pattern across the three forest stands suggest that climatic variability is driving short-term patterns in these soil properties rather than seasonal inputs of litter. In general, soils were warmer, drier and more basic with higher available P during dry season months. Even in wet tropical forests, small variability in climate can play an important role in soil dynamics over periods of weeks to months. Although litter manipulation did not influence soil properties over the 5-month study period, a longer lag may exist between the timing of litter inputs and the influence of that litter on soil properties, especially plant available P.},

	abstract = {To evaluate the effects of logging on soil greenhouse gas flux in a tropical rain forest, we measured CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes at logged and unlogged sites in Peninsular Malaysia (N = 7–27 at each site). Although soil temperature at the logged sites was higher than at unlogged sites, soil CO2 flux did not differ between sites. The CH4 consumption at the logged sites tended to be less than that at unlogged sites, and some soils at the logged sites emitted CH4. These results suggest that logging can decrease CH4 consumption or even convert CH4 sinks into sources. The increase in soil bulk density after logging might lowered the effective diffusivity of CH4 and O2 availability in soils, which might limit the CH4 consumption at the logged sites. N2O fluxes were increased significantly for at least 1 year after logging because of an increase in soil nitrogen availability. Logging decreased the CH4 absorption rate and increased the N2O emission rate of the soil. Based on these findings, we conclude that logging in tropical rain forests increases the emission of CH4 and N2O for at least 1 year after logging, thus potentially contributing to global warming.},

How local ecological assemblages are responding is less clear—a concern given their importance for many ecosystem functions and services. We analysed a terrestrial assemblage database of unprecedented geographic and taxonomic coverage to quantify local biodiversity responses to land use and related changes. Here we show that in the worst-affected habitats, these pressures reduce within-sample species richness by an average of 76.5\%, total abundance by 39.5\% and rarefaction-based richness by 40.3\%. We estimate that, globally, these pressures have already slightly reduced average within-sample richness (by 13.6\%), total abundance (10.7\%) and rarefaction-based richness (8.1\%), with changes showing marked spatial variation. Rapid further losses are predicted under a business-as-usual land-use scenario; within-sample richness is projected to fall by a further 3.4\% globally by 2100, with losses concentrated in biodiverse but economically poor countries. Strong mitigation can deliver much more positive biodiversity changes (up to a 1.9\% average increase) that are less strongly related to countries' socioeconomic status.},

	abstract = {Increasing concern about the impacts of global warming on biodiversity has stimulated extensive discussion, but methods to translate broad-scale shifts in climate into direct impacts on living animals remain simplistic. A key missing element from models of climatic change impacts on animals is the buffering influence of behavioral thermoregulation. Here, we show how behavioral and mass/energy balance models can be combined with spatial data on climate, topography, and vegetation to predict impacts of increased air temperature on thermoregulating ectotherms such as reptiles and insects (a large portion of global biodiversity). We show that for most "cold-blooded" terrestrial animals, the primary thermal challenge is not to attain high body temperatures (although this is important in temperate environments) but to stay cool (particularly in tropical and desert areas, where ectotherm biodiversity is greatest). The impact of climate warming on thermoregulating ectotherms will depend critically on how changes in vegetation cover alter the availability of shade as well as the animals' capacities to alter their seasonal timing of activity and reproduction. Warmer environments also may increase maintenance energy costs while simultaneously constraining activity time, putting pressure on mass and energy budgets. Energy-and mass-balance models provide a general method to integrate the complexity of these direct interactions between organisms and climate into spatial predictions of the impact of climate change on biodiversity. This methodology allows quantitative organism-and habitat-specific assessments of climate change impacts.},

	abstract = {We find that most terrestrial ectotherms are insufficiently tolerant of high temperatures to survive the warmest potential body temperatures in exposed habitats and must therefore thermoregulate by using shade, burrows, or evaporative cooling. Our results reveal that exposure to extreme heat can occur even at high elevations and latitudes and show why heat-tolerance limits are relatively invariant in comparison with cold limits. To survive climate warming, ectotherms in most areas may need to rely on behaviors—and have access to habitats—that provide a reprieve from extreme operative temperatures., Physiological thermal-tolerance limits of terrestrial ectotherms often exceed local air temperatures, implying a high degree of thermal safety (an excess of warm or cold thermal tolerance). However, air temperatures can be very different from the equilibrium body temperature of an individual ectotherm. Here, we compile thermal-tolerance limits of ectotherms across a wide range of latitudes and elevations and compare these thermal limits both to air and to operative body temperatures (theoretically equilibrated body temperatures) of small ectothermic animals during the warmest and coldest times of the year. We show that extreme operative body temperatures in exposed habitats match or exceed the physiological thermal limits of most ectotherms. Therefore, contrary to previous findings using air temperatures, most ectotherms do not have a physiological thermal-safety margin. They must therefore rely on behavior to avoid overheating during the warmest times, especially in the lowland tropics. Likewise, species living at temperate latitudes and in alpine habitats must retreat to avoid lethal cold exposure. Behavioral plasticity of habitat use and the energetic consequences of thermal retreats are therefore critical aspects of species’ vulnerability to climate warming and extreme events.},

These buffered microhabitats may be used by species to evade extreme weather and novel climates in the future. Yet, the magnitude and extent of this buffering on a global scale remains unknown. Across all tropical continents and using 36 published studies, we assessed temperature buffering from within microhabitats across various habitat strata and structures (e.g. soil, logs, epiphytes and tree holes) and compared them to non-buffered macro-scale ambient temperatures (the thermal control). Microhabitats buffered temperature by 3.9°C and reduced maximum temperatures by 3.5°C. Buffering was most pronounced in tropical lowlands where temperatures were most variable. With the expected increase in extreme weather events, microhabitats should provide species with a local layer of protection that is not captured by traditional climate assessments, which are typically derived from macro-scale temperatures (e.g. satellites). Our data illustrate the need for a next generation of predictive models that account for species' ability to move within microhabitats to exploit favourable buffered microclimates.},

	abstract = {Edge is an important landscape feature of fragmented forest landscapes in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Our primary objective of this study is to characterize the changes in microclimatic variables from recent clearcut edges into the old-growth Douglas-fir forests as influenced by edge exposures and local weather conditions. Microclimatic gradients are described along transects extending from recently clearcut edges 240 m into stands of old-growth Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) forest west of the Cascade Range in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Data for air temperature, soil temperature, relative humidity, short-wave radiation, and wind speed were collected over the course of the day from 16 different edges representing a range of edge orientations and local weather conditions over two growing seasons (1989-1990). Data for soil moisture were collected over three consecutive days in September 1990. Two indices, significance of edge influence (SEI) and depth of edge influence (DEI), were used to evaluate the effects of edges on microclimatic variables. Edge effects typically extended 30 to {\textgreater}240 m into the forest. From the edge into the forest, air temperatures decreased during the day and increased at night; the reversal produced mid-morning and late-afternoon periods when a gradient was absent. Changes in soil temperature from the edge into the forest were comparable to those for air temperature, except that edge effects did not extend as deeply into the forest. The gradient for relative humidity increased from the edge and was steepest in mid-afternoon. Humidity effects sometimes extended {\textgreater}240 m into the forest. Short-wave radiation decreased rapidly with distance from the edge, reaching interior forest levels by 30-60 m. Wind speed decreased exponentially from the edge into the forest, depending on the relationship of edge orientation to wind direction; stronger winds influenced conditions deeper inside the forest, sometimes {\textgreater}240 m from the edge. Edge orientation played a critical role for all variables; for air and soil temperature and humidity, it affected the times of day at which maximum and minimum values peaked. Influence of local weather conditions on gradients was highly variable. Overall, however, gradients generally were longest and steepest on partially clear, warm, dry days, at southwest-facing edges, and for air temperature, soil temperature, and relative humidity. SEI and DEI were found to be necessary measurements for evaluating edge effects on microclimatic variables, which responded differently depending on time of day, edge orientation, and local weather. No single value could be calculated for DEI. Because many ecological features near edges, such as tree stocking and regeneration, dispersal of flying insects, and decomposition of woody debris, seem related to microclimatic gradients, forest management to protect interior conditions should shift from the traditional charge (@'create as much edge as possible@') to a new charge in which the amount of edge is reduced at both the stand and landscape levels.},

For global averages, the annual range of precipitation tends to increase as the globe warms. On a regional basis, this enhancement is found over most areas of the world, except for the bands along 30°S and 30°N. The enhancement in the annual range of precipitation is mainly associated with larger upward trends of maximum precipitation and smaller upward trends or downward trends of minimum precipitation. Based on the moisture budget analysis, the dominant mechanism is vertical moisture advection, both on a global average and on a regional scale. The vertical moisture advection, moisture convergence induced by vertical motion, includes the thermodynamic component, which is associated with increased water vapor, and the dynamic component, which is associated with changes in circulation. Generally, the thermodynamic component enhances the annual range of precipitation, while the dynamic component tends to reduce it. Evaporation has a positive contribution to both maximum and minimum precipitation, but very little to the annual range of precipitation. Even though evaporation and horizontal moisture advection are small for a global average, they could be important on a regional basis.},

While previous detection and attribution studies demonstrated a significant human influence on the recent warming of daily extremes, contributions of individual anthropogenic forcings like changes in land use have not yet been investigated in such studies. Here we apply an optimal fingerprinting technique to data from observations and experiments with a new earth system model to examine whether changing land use has led to detectable changes in daily extreme temperatures on a quasi-global scale. We find that loss of trees and increase of grassland since preindustrial times has caused an overall cooling trend in both mean and extreme temperatures which is detectable in the observed changes of warm but not cold extremes. The warming in both mean and extreme temperatures due to anthropogenic forcings other than land use is detected in all cases, whereas the weaker effect of natural climatic forcings is not detected in any. This is the first formal attribution of observed climatic changes to changing land use, suggesting further investigations are justified, particularly in studies of warm extremes.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have indicated how tropical deforestation can have a significant influence on regional and global climate through altered biophysical exchanges of water, energy, and momentum at the land-atmosphere boundary. However, the mechanisms for translating a surface forcing to changes in the atmospheric thermodynamics and circulation have not received as much attention. Here we present a new moist static energy budget method for examining the regional atmospheric response to removal of tropical forests and how land surface forcing is propagated into the atmosphere. A detailed three-dimensional grid cell energy budget approach is used within a coupled atmosphere-biosphere model (Community Climate Model, Version 3–Integrated Biosphere Simulator (CCM3-IBIS)) to identify how land surface forcing affects the regional climate through the vertical and horizontal movement of moist static energy. This approach allows us to clearly identify where the moist static energy budget changes, which mechanisms are responsible for the changes, and how energy moves to adjacent areas and affects rainfall. Generally, replacement of the tropical forests with bare soil in the model leads to decreased rainfall in the tropics due to regional drying, while enhanced rainfall occurs in the subtropics associated with strengthened monsoon winds importing more moisture. Interesting regional complexities emerge, notably in tropical Africa. There, removal of the forests leads to lower rainfall near the coast but enhanced rainfall in central tropical Africa. This approach provides a useful diagnostic tool for examining the implications of land use and land cover change on the regional and global atmospheric thermodynamics and circulation.},

Regions of altered land cover include large portions of Europe, India, eastern China, and the eastern United States. Smaller areas of change are present in various tropical regions. This study focuses on the impacts of biophysical changes associated with the land cover change (albedo, root and stomatal properties, roughness length), which is almost exclusively a conversion from forest to grassland in the model; the effects of irrigation or other water management practices and the effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide changes associated with land cover conversion are not included in these experiments. The model suggests that observed land cover changes have little or no impact on globally averaged climatic variables (e.g., 2-m air temperature is 0.008 K warmer in a simulation with 1990 land cover compared to a simulation with potential natural vegetation cover). Differences in the annual mean climatic fields analyzed did not exhibit global field significance. Within some of the regions of land cover change, however, there are relatively large changes of many surface climatic variables. These changes are highly significant locally in the annual mean and in most months of the year in eastern Europe and northern India. They can be explained mainly as direct and indirect consequences of model-prescribed increases in surface albedo, decreases in rooting depth, and changes of stomatal control that accompany deforestation.},

	abstract = {A fully coupled land–ocean–atmosphere GCM is used to explore the biogeophysical impact of large-scale deforestation on surface climate. By analyzing the model sensitivity to global-scale replacement of forests by grassland, it is shown that the surface albedo increase owing to deforestation has a cooling effect of −1.36 K globally. On the other hand, forest removal decreases evapotranspiration efficiency and decreases surface roughness, both leading to a global surface warming of 0.24 and 0.29 K, respectively. The net biogeophysical impact of deforestation results from the competition between these effects. Globally, the albedo effect is dominant because of its wider-scale impact, and the net biogeophysical impact of deforestation is thus a cooling of −1 K. Over land, the balance between the different processes varies with latitude. In temperate and boreal zones of the Northern Hemisphere the albedo effect is stronger and deforestation thus induces a cooling. Conversely, in the tropics the net impact of deforestation is a warming, because evapotranspiration efficiency and surface roughness provide the dominant influence. The authors also explore the importance of the ocean coupling in shaping the climate response to deforestation. First, the temperature over ocean responds to the land cover perturbation. Second, even the temperature change over land is greatly affected by the ocean coupling. By assuming fixed oceanic conditions, the net effect of deforestation, averaged over all land areas, is a warming, whereas taking into account the coupling with the ocean leads, on the contrary, to a net land cooling. Furthermore, it is shown that the main parameter involved in the coupling with the ocean is surface albedo. Indeed, a change in albedo modifies temperature and humidity in the whole troposphere, thus enabling the initially land-confined perturbation to be transferred to the ocean. Finally, the radiative forcing framework is discussed in the context of land cover change impact on climate. The experiments herein illustrate that deforestation triggers two opposite types of forcing mechanisms—radiative forcing (owing to surface albedo change) and nonradiative forcing (owing to change in evapotranspiration efficiency and surface roughness)—that exhibit a similar magnitude globally. However, when applying the radiative forcing concept, nonradiative processes are ignored, which may lead to a misrepresentation of land cover change impact on climate.},

We measure bird movements directly, over relatively large scales of space and time, both before and after landscape fragmentation. We found that species which disappear from fragments move extensively between plots before isolation, but not after, and often disperse to longer distances in continuous forest than in fragmented forest. Such species also preferentially emigrate from smaller to larger fragments, showing no preference in continuous forest. In contrast, species that persist in fragments are generally less mobile, do not cross gaps as often, yet disperse further after fragmentation than before. ‘Heavy tailed’ probability models usually explain dispersal kernels better than exponential or Gaussian models, suggesting tropical forest birds may be better dispersers than assumed with some individuals moving very long distances.},

	abstract = {Abstract: To anticipate the rapidly changing world resulting from global climate change, the projections of climate models must be incorporated into conservation. This requires that the scales of conservation be aligned with the scales of climate-change projections. We considered how conservation has incorporated spatial scale into protecting biodiversity, how the projections of climate-change models vary with scale, and how the two do or do not align. Conservation planners use information about past and current ecological conditions at multiple scales to identify conservation targets and threats and guide conservation actions. Projections of climate change are also made at multiple scales, from global and regional circulation models to projections downscaled to local scales. These downscaled projections carry with them the uncertainties associated with the broad-scale models from which they are derived; thus, their high resolution may be more apparent than real. Conservation at regional or global scales is about establishing priorities and influencing policy. At these scales, the coarseness and uncertainties of global and regional climate models may be less important than what they reveal about possible futures. At the ecoregional scale, the uncertainties associated with downscaling climate models become more critical because the distributions of conservation targets on which plans are founded may shift under future climates. At a local scale, variations in topography and land cover influence local climate, often overriding the projections of broad-scale climate models and increasing uncertainty. Despite the uncertainties, ecologists and conservationists must work with climate-change modelers to focus on the most likely projections. The future will be different from the past and full of surprises; judicious use of model projections at appropriate scales may help us prepare.},

Specifically, the framework addresses how fragmentation changes temperature and how the effects of those temperature changes spread through the ecosystem, from organism response via thermal sensitivity, to changes in species distribution and activity patterns, to shifts in community structure following species' responses, and ultimately to changes in ecosystem functions. We place a strong emphasis on future research directions by outlining “Critical gaps” for each step of the framework.

General circulation models show that completely deforesting the tropics could result in global warming equivalent to that caused by burning of fossil fuels since 1850, with more warming and considerable drying in the tropics. More realistic scenarios of deforestation yield less warming and less drying, suggesting critical thresholds beyond which rainfall is substantially reduced. In regional, mesoscale models that capture topography and vegetation-based discontinuities, small clearings can actually enhance rainfall. At this smaller scale as well, a critical deforestation threshold exists, beyond which rainfall declines. Future agricultural productivity in the tropics is at risk from a deforestation-induced increase in mean temperature and the associated heat extremes and from a decline in mean rainfall or rainfall frequency. Through teleconnections, negative impacts on agriculture could extend well beyond the tropics.},

However, models cannot accurately reproduce local climate effects due to their coarse spatial resolution and uncertainties, and field observations are valuable but often insufficient due to their limited coverage.

Results show that tropical forests have a strong cooling effect throughout the year; temperate forests show moderate cooling in summer and moderate warming in winter with net cooling annually; and boreal forests have strong warming in winter and moderate cooling in summer with net warming annually. The spatiotemporal cooling or warming effects are mainly driven by the two competing biophysical effects, evapotranspiration and albedo, which in turn are strongly influenced by rainfall and snow. Implications of our satellite-based study could be useful for informing local forestry policies.,

In the region of Alta Floresta (Mato Grosso, Brazil), deforestation has been intense with over half the forests being cut since 1970. This article first examines the evolution of precipitation observed in this region and shows a significant trend in the decrease in total precipitation especially at the end of the dry season and at the beginning of the rainy season. The study then compares the temperatures measured in cleared and forested sectors within a reserve in the area of Alta Floresta (Mato Grosso, Brazil) between 2006 and 2007.

	abstract = {Temperature provides a powerful theme for exploring environmental adaptation at all levels of biological organization, from molecular kinetics to organismal fitness to global biogeography. First, the thermodynamic properties that underlie biochemical kinetics and protein stability determine the overall thermal sensitivity of rate processes. Consequently, a single quantitative framework can assess variation in thermal sensitivity of ectotherms in terms of single amino acid substitutions, quantitative genetics, and interspecific differences. Thermodynamic considerations predict that higher optimal temperatures will result in greater maximal fitness at the optimum, a pattern seen both in interspecific comparisons and in within‐population genotypic variation. Second, the temperature‐size rule (increased developmental temperature causes decreased adult body size) is a common pattern of phenotypic plasticity in ectotherms. Mechanistic models can correctly predict the rule in some taxa, but lab and field studies show that rapid evolution can weaken or even break the rule. Third, phenotypic and evolutionary models for thermal sensitivity can be combined to explore potential fitness consequences of climate warming for terrestrial ectotherms. Recent analyses suggest that climate change will have greater negative fitness consequences for tropical than for temperate ectotherms, because many tropical species have relatively narrow thermal breadths and smaller thermal safety margins.},

	abstract = {Distribution of species across the Earth shows strong latitudinal and altitudinal gradients with the number of species decreasing with declining temperatures. While these patterns have been recognized for well over a century, the mechanisms generating and maintaining them have remained elusive. Here, we propose a mechanistic explanation for temperature-dependent rates of molecular evolution that can influence speciation rates and global biodiversity gradients. Our hypothesis is based on the effects of temperature and temperature-adaptation on stability of proteins and other catalytic biomolecules. First, due to the nature of physical forces between biomolecules and water, stability of biomolecules is maximal around + 20°C and decreases as temperature either decreases or increases. Second, organisms that have adapted to cold temperatures have evolved especially flexible (but unstable) proteins to facilitate catalytic reactions in cold, where molecular movements slow down. Both these effects should result in mutations being on average more detrimental at cold temperatures (i.e. lower mutational robustness in cold). At high temperatures, destabilizing water–biomolecule interactions, and the need to maintain structures that withstand heat denaturation, should decrease mutational robustness similarly. Decreased mutational robustness at extreme temperatures will slow down molecular evolution, as a larger fraction of new mutations will be removed by selection. Lower mutational robustness may also select for reduced mutation rates, further slowing down the rate of molecular evolution. As speciation requires the evolution of epistatic incompatibilities that prevent gene flow among incipient species, slow rate of molecular evolution at extreme temperatures will directly slow down the rate at which new species arise. The proposed mechanism can thus explain why molecular evolution is faster at warm temperatures, contributing to higher speciation rate and elevated species richness in environments characterized by stable and warm temperatures.},

Fluxes from swamp forest soils were also measured once per year as the native state of this investigated area. Land-use change from drained forest to lowland paddy field significantly decreased the CO2 (from 266 to 30 mg C m−2 h−1) and N2O fluxes (from 25.4 to 3.8 μg N m−2 h−1), but increased the CH4 flux (from 0.1 to 4.2 mg C m−2 h−1) in the soils. Change from drained forest to cassava field significantly increased N2O flux (from 25.4 to 62.2 μg N m−2 h−1), but had no significant influence on CO2 (from 266 to 200 mg C m−2 h−1) and CH4 fluxes (from 0.1 to 0.3 mg C m−2 h−1) in the soils. Averaged CO2 fluxes in the swamp forests (94 mg C m−2 h−1) were estimated to be one-third of that in the drained forest. Groundwater levels of drained forest and upland crop fields had been lowered by drainage ditches while swamp forest and lowland paddy field were flooded, although groundwater levels were also affected by precipitation. Groundwater levels were negatively related to CO2 flux but positively related to CH4 flux at all investigation sites. The peak of the N2O flux was observed at –20 cm of groundwater level. Lowering the groundwater level by 10 cm from the soil surface resulted in a 50 increase in CO2 emission (from 109.1 to 162.4 mg C m−2 h−1) and a 25\% decrease in CH4 emission (from 0.440 to 0.325 mg C m−2 h−1) in this study. These results suggest that lowering of groundwater level by the drainage ditches in the peat lands contributes to global warming and devastation of fields. Swamp forest was probably the best land-use management in peat lands to suppress the carbon loss and greenhouse gas emission. Lowland paddy field was a better agricultural system in the peat lands in terms of C sequestration and greenhouse gas emission. Carbon loss from lowland paddy field was one-eighth of that of the other upland crop systems, although the Global Warming Potential was almost the same level as that of the other upland crop systems because of CH4 emission through rice plants.},

Microclimatic parameters and phorophyte identities were correlated to differences in cover, diversity and species composition of bryophyte assemblages by means of Kruskal–Wallis tests, non-metric multidimensional scaling and indicator species analysis. High relative humidity and in particular daily fluctuations in relative humidity proved to be the most important factors for epiphyll distribution suggesting severe constraints of epiphyll colonisation by pronounced humidity fluctuations. Differences in air temperature and light availability as well as phorophyte identity were only weakly correlated with bryophyte cover and diversity. However, species composition of epiphyllous assemblages was related to all microclimatic variables as well as to phorophyte identity. The strong response of epiphyllous bryophytes to even subtle microclimatic variations suggests that undisturbed forest canopies and their control on microclimate may be essential for the development of epiphyll communities.},

In addition, four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios of the future (2005–2100) are being provided by four Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) teams to be used as input to the ESMs for future carbon-climate projections (Moss et al. 2010). The diversity of approaches and requirements among IAMs and ESMs for tracking land-use change, along with the dependence of model projections on land-use history, presents a challenge for effectively passing data between these communities and for smoothly transitioning from the historical estimates to future projections. Here, a harmonized set of land-use scenarios are presented that smoothly connects historical reconstructions of land use with future projections, in the format required by ESMs. The land-use harmonization strategy estimates fractional land-use patterns and underlying land-use transitions annually for the time period 1500–2100 at 0.5° × 0.5° resolution. Inputs include new gridded historical maps of crop and pasture data from HYDE 3.1 for 1500–2005, updated estimates of historical national wood harvest and of shifting cultivation, and future information on crop, pasture, and wood harvest from the IAM implementations of the RCPs for the period 2005–2100. The computational method integrates these multiple data sources, while minimizing differences at the transition between the historical reconstruction ending conditions and IAM initial conditions, and working to preserve the future changes depicted by the IAMs at the grid cell level. This study for the first time harmonizes land-use history data together with future scenario information from multiple IAMs into a single consistent, spatially gridded, set of land-use change scenarios for studies of human impacts on the past, present, and future Earth system.},

	abstract = {Background  Tropical forest species are among the most sensitive to changing climatic conditions, and the forest they inhabit helps to buffer their microclimate from the variable climatic conditions outside the forest. However, habitat fragmentation and edge effects exposes vegetation to outside microclimatic conditions, thereby reducing the ability of the forest to buffer climatic variation. In this paper, we ask what proportion of forest in a fragmented ecosystem is impacted by altered microclimate conditions driven by edge effects, and extrapolate these results to the whole Atlantic Forest biome, one of the most disturbed biodiversity hotspots. To address these questions, we collected above and below ground temperature for a full year using temperature sensors placed in forest fragments of different sizes, and at different distances from the forest edge.    Principal Findings  In the Atlantic forests of Brazil, we found that the buffering effect of forests reduced maximum outside temperatures by one third or more at ground level within a forest, with the buffering effect being stronger below-ground than one metre above-ground. The temperature buffering effect of forests was, however, reduced near forest edges with the edge effect extending up to 20 m inside the forest. The heavily fragmented nature of the Brazilian Atlantic forest means that 12\% of the remaining biome experiences altered microclimate conditions.    Conclusions  Our results add further information about the extent of edge effects in the Atlantic Forest, and we suggest that maintaining a low perimeter-to-area ratio may be a judicious method for minimizing the amount of forest area that experiences altered microclimatic conditions in this ecosystem.},

A holdout is a population that persists in a microclimate for a limited period of time under deteriorating climatic conditions. Stepping stones successively occupy microclimates in a way that facilitates species’ range shifts. Microrefugia refer to populations that persist in microclimates through a period of unfavorable climate. Because climate projections show that return to present climate is highly unlikely, conservation strategies need to be built around holdouts and stepping stones, rather than low-probability microrefugia.},

	abstract = {Given the dramatic loss of tropical forests and accelerating climate change, secondary forest regeneration is increasingly recognised as being an important method for reversing losses in biodiversity and carbon stocks. The recolonisation of biodiversity within secondary forests depends in part upon the recovery of forest structure, including the range of microhabitats used by diverse local communities. Here, we investigate the return of critical microhabitats along a successional gradient of secondary forest in the Tropical Andes of Colombia. We measured the abundance of live (bromeliads, tree ferns and moss) and dead (deadwood and leaf litter) microhabitats across three landscapes, each encompassing primary, and young (4–18 yr old) and old secondary forests (19–35 yr old). Considering the increasing rate of climate warming in the region, we also explored whether these microhabitats provide thermally buffered microclimates. We found that secondary forests have different composition and lower complexity of microhabitats than primary forests, but microhabitats appear to be recovering towards primary forest levels. Furthermore, in all forest types, microhabitats had lower maximum temperatures and higher minimum temperatures, thereby serving as thermal buffers that reduced exposure to extreme temperatures. These benefits exist despite ambient temperatures in secondary forests surpassing those of primary forests by 1–2 °C on average. The protection of secondary forest and promotion of further forest regrowth in the Tropical Andes should represent an urgent investment for conservation, and the value of these forests for offering critical microhabitats and buffered microclimates under climate change should not be overlooked.},

	abstract = {* Human alteration of the global environment is leading to a pervasive loss of biodiversity. Most studies evaluating human impacts on biodiversity occur after the disturbance has taken place using spatially distinct sites to determine the undisturbed reference condition. This approach is known as a space-for-time (SFT) substitution. However, SFT substitution could be underestimating biodiversity loss if spatial controls fail to provide adequate inferences about pre-disturbance conditions.


* We compare the SFT substitution with a before–after control–impact (BACI) approach by assessing dung beetles before and after a logging exploration in the Brazilian Amazon. We sampled 34 logging management units, of which 29 were selectively logged with different intensities after our first collection. We used dung beetle species richness, species composition and biomass as our biodiversity response metrics and the gradient of selective logging intensity as our explanatory metric.


* Only the BACI approach consistently demonstrated the negative impacts of logging intensification on all dung beetle community metrics. Moreover, the BACI approach explained significantly more of the variance in all the relationships and it doubled the estimates of species loss along the gradient of logging intensity when compared to SFT.


* Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that space-for-time (SFT) substitution may greatly underestimate the consequences on local species diversity and community turnover. These results have important implications for researchers investigating human impacts on biodiversity. Incentivizing before–after control–impact (BACI) approaches will require longer-term funding to gather the data and stronger links between researchers and landowners. However, BACI approaches are accompanied by many logistical constraints, making the continued use of SFT studies inevitable in many cases. We highlight that non-significant results and weak effects should be viewed with caution.},

	abstract = {Abstract: In recent decades the rate and geographic extent of land-use and land-cover change has increased throughout the world's humid tropical forests. The pan-tropical geography of forest change is a challenge to assess, and improved estimates of the human footprint in the tropics are critical to understanding potential changes in biodiversity. We combined recently published and new satellite observations, along with images from Google Earth and a literature review, to estimate the contemporary global extent of deforestation, selective logging, and secondary regrowth in humid tropical forests. Roughly 1.4\% of the biome was deforested between 2000 and 2005. As of 2005, about half of the humid tropical forest biome contained 50\% or less tree cover. Although not directly comparable to deforestation, geographic estimates of selective logging indicate that at least 20\% of the humid tropical forest biome was undergoing some level of timber harvesting between 2000 and 2005. Forest recovery estimates are even less certain, but a compilation of available reports suggests that at least 1.2\% of the humid tropical forest biome was in some stage of long-term secondary regrowth in 2000. Nearly 70\% of the regrowth reports indicate forest regeneration in hilly, upland, and mountainous environments considered marginal for large-scale agriculture and ranching. Our estimates of the human footprint are conservative because they do not resolve very small-scale deforestation, low-intensity logging, and unreported secondary regrowth, nor do they incorporate other impacts on tropical forest ecosystems, such as fire and hunting. Our results highlight the enormous geographic extent of forest change throughout the humid tropics and the considerable limitations of the science and technology available for such a synthesis.},
