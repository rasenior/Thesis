## Threats to biodiversity

Recent rates of species extinction are between 100 and 1000 times greater than pre-human levels [@pimm_future_1995]. It is estimated that if all species currently classified as Critically Endangered were to go extinct, the Earth would enter its sixth mass extinction event [@barnosky_has_2011]. Awareness and mitigating action by humans has increased accordingly in recent years, but the loss of biodiversity has not slowed [@butchart_global_2010].

The key drivers of biodiversity loss are land-use change, climate change, pollution, over-exploitation and invasive species [@hirsch_global_2010]. These drivers have varying importance depending on location and taxonomic group [@baillie_2004_2004]. The greatest overall threat to terrestrial systems is currently land-use change, with climate change becoming increasingly important as the century progresses [@sala_global_2000]. 

Tackling the extinction crisis is a monumental undertaking, which raises the question -- why bother? The importance of biodiversity can be broken down broadly into intrinsic and extrinsic value. Intrinsic value underpins much of traditional conservation thinking, and is based on the notion that all life has inherent value and the right to exist [@mea_ecosystems_2005]. Extinsic value encompasses ecosystem products and services, recognising the tangible benefits that humans derive from nature [@balmford_economic_2002; @costanza_value_1997]. Another consideration is that conserving maximum biodiversity is likely to maintain redundancy in the planetary system as a whole. Crudely, the more genes, traits, species etc. that exist, the less likely that loss through natural or anthropogenic disturbance causes whole processes and ecosystems to collapse [@oliver_declining_2015]. Ecosystem resilience is important at local and regional scales, where its absence may be felt most tangibly by humans, but without global resilience we are likely to exceed planetary boundaries with severe negative consequences for all life on Earth [@rockstrom_safe_2009].

With limited resources, conservation must prioritise places that are most imperilled and convey the most benefits for people and for biodiversity. Most of the world's terrestrial biodiversity is found in the tropics [@jenkins_global_2013], including species yet to be discovered [@scheffers_what_2012; @joppa_biodiversity_2011] and, therefore, with unknown benefits. The tropics also includes some of the world's only remaining wilderness areas [@mittermeier_wilderness_2003], which are irreplacable within any timescale that matters to humans. Tropical forests play a key role in the global carbon cycle and atmospheric circulation [@foley_global_2005], and can accrue local benefits to some of the world's most deprived people and countries [REF]. Simultaneously, the tropics are disproportionately threatened by ongoing disturbance by humans, some of which may negatively interact to exacerbate the consequences for biodiversity. 

## Land-use change in the tropics

The tropics are undergoing a huge amount of land-use change, most of which comprises either loss or degradation of tropical forest. Land-use change has already driven extensive and severe losses of biodiversity across the planet [@newbold_global_2015], so there is a clear need to understand what underpins these losses and how they can be mitigated.

### Forest conversion

Globally there is increasing demand for agricultural land to feed a growing and developing human population [@godfray_food_2010;@tilman_global_2011;@foley_solutions_2011]. The primary source of new agricultural land is tropical forests [@gibbs_tropical_2010], because temperate regions have already undergone severe land-use change and because demand for food is increasingly most rapidly in developing countries, which are mostly found in the tropics [@hdr_2018]. The result has been a devastating loss of habitat, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Amazon [@gibbs_tropical_2010; @hansen_high-resolution_2013]. Deforestation is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions [@foley_global_2005; @ipcc_climate_2013], compunding impacts for global biodiversity by driving climate change. Additionally, forest loss has numerous secondary impacts, such as opening up remaining forest to exploitation for timber or hunting, and delineating forests into small fragments with associated edge effects and hazards from road traffic [@laurance_impacts_2009; @murcia_edge_1995; @pfeifer_creation_2017; @ewers_fragmentation_2013].

### Forest degradation

Forest degradation refers to negative, human-caused changes to forest that do not cause complete loss of forest cover. Degradation includes the secondary impacts of nearby deforestation as described above (e.g. fragmentation and poaching), as well as direct degradation through selective logging. While the impacts of deforestation may be more exreme locally than forest degradation, wholesale conversion affected only 1.4% of the humid tropical biome from 2000 to 2005, compared to 20% that was designated for selective logging in the same period [@asner_contemporary_2009; @hansen_humid_2008]. The term 'selective' refers to the targeting of particular species and stems [usually above a minimum trunk diameter;  @edwards_maintaining_2014], however these targets are typically the largest, oldest trees, the removal of which reduces canopy height and canopy density [@kumar_effects_2005; @okuda_effect_2003], fragments the forest canopy and opens up large gaps [@edwards_maintaining_2014] that are often invaded by non-tree species, such as climbers and bamboo. Commercial selective logging also causes collateral damage, particularly where trees are connected by climbers [@schnitzer_recruitment_2004], and it requires roads and skid trails that bring further challenges for wildlife [@brodie_correlation_2014; @laurance_global_2014], as well as heavy machinery that cause soil compaction [@putz_reduced-impact_2008]. Degraded tropical forests are significant for global conservation because a greater proportion of species found in undisturbed habitat remain there than in converted habitat, and it is often these species that are of primary conservation concern [@edwards_degraded_2011; @gibson_primary_2011; @edwards_biodiversity_2013]

## Climate change in the tropics

While land-use change is the biggest current driver of biodiversity loss, and will certainly continue to be a major threat to tropical species [@gibbs_tropical_2010], conservation must also seek to bolster species against additional threats that are likely to negatively interact with land-use change, particularly climate change [@maxwell_biodiversity:_2016]. There is some debate about the vulnerability of tropical species to climate change, relative to species at higher latitudes, which has led climate research to be neglected in this region until recently [@corlett_climate_2012]. 

Vulnerability to climate change depends on exposure (extinsic factors) and species' sensitivity (intrinsic factors) [@williams_towards_2008]. Exposure and senstivity interact to determine whether species _need_ to resist or recover from climate perturbations, as well as their _ability_ to do so. In terms of absolute changes in climate, exposure will be less in the tropics than elsewhere [@ipcc_climate_2013]. Relative change, however, will be greatest in the tropics because of long periods of climatic stability [@mora_projected_2013]. Temperature in the tropics also varies very little within the year or with latitude [@colwell_global_2008], predisposing tropical species to high thermal sensitivity because of their narrow thermal limits [@deutsch_impacts_2008; @tewksbury_putting_2008; @khaliq_global_2014], with many species already operating near the upper end of those limits [@deutsch_impacts_2008; @tewksbury_putting_2008; @corlett_impacts_2011]. 

Land-use change can directly influence species' exposure to climate change by changing vegetation structure. Evidence from global General Circulation Models [@findell_modeled_2007; @davin_climatic_2010; @pielke_land_2011] and observational studies in Brazil [@loarie_velocity_2009], Malaysia [@luskin_microclimate_2011] and Indonesia [@ramdani_local_2014], demonstrate that loss of vegetation cover increases local daytime temperature by reducing direct absorption and reflection of incident solar radiation [@oke_boundary_1987; @murcia_edge_1995; @snyder_analyzing_2004], and by reducing the amount of thermal energy dissipated through evapotranspiration [@oke_boundary_1987; @findell_modeled_2007; @lawrence_effects_2015]. However, studies that rely on coarse-scale (~ 1 km) weather station data have limited relevance for the majority of terrestrial species [@frenne_weather_2016], which experience temperature at mm to m, within a few cm of the ground surface and usually with overhead vegetation and variation in topography [@wiens_matching_2010; @gillingham_relative_2010; @suggitt_habitat_2011]. Local observational studies are able to account for these factors, but are difficult to generalise across regions, land-use types, times of year (e.g. dry versus wet season) and habitat strata (e.g. above-ground versus below-ground). In \autoref{ch2} I combine the advantages of both approaches by using site-level temperature data from across the tropics in a mixed effects modelling framework, to ask how land-use change impacts local temperature in different land-use types, seasons and above-ground versus below-ground [also see @senior_pantropical_2017]. 

Assuming tropical species are exposed to climate change and do need to respond, another key interaction to consider is the extent to which land-use change affects the ability of species to adaptively respond to climate change. There are several ways that species can respond to climate change, broadly divided into adapting *in situ* and moving elsewhere [@corlett_impacts_2011].

### In situ adaptation

#### Genetic adaptation

As yet there is limited evidence for evolutionary responses to climate change, in the tropics or elsewhere [@corlett_impacts_2011; @parmesan_ecological_2006]. It could be that there has not yet been sufficient time or selection pressure to drive such change, alhough evidence is also lacking in the fossil record despite climate change of much greater magnitude during events such as the Pleistocene glaciation event [@parmesan_ecological_2006]. Genetic adaptation is less intuitive and harder to document than ecological responses [@oconnor_toward_2012], and is less likely in tropical species of high conservation concern because these species are highly specialised, and specialisation tends to reduce variation in heritable traits and thus decrease potential for genetic adaptation [@williams_towards_2008]. Thermal tolerance, especially upper thermal limits, appear to be highly constrained in the species that have been assessed [@hoffmann_upper_2013]. Evidence from temperate regions suggests a more common phenomenon is evolution in traits that underlie other adaptive responses to climate change. For example, Dutch great tits that have greater plasticity in their timing of reproduction are better able to match egg-laying to food availability -- the peak of which has advanced as a result of climate change -- and thus achieve greater fitness [@nussey_selection_2005]. Meanwhile, some British insects have evolved improved flight capacity, which is thought to asisst dispersal to track shifting climate conditions [@hill_flight_1999; @thomas_ecological_2001].

#### Physiological plasticity

Similar to genetic adaptation, acclimation of thermal tolerance directly appears to be limited [@hoffmann_upper_2013; @parmesan_ecological_2006], but there is ample evidence for phenological changes. Again, most evidence derives from temperate regions of the Northern hemisphere, where seasonality is the overarching determinant of species' phenology, and is itself dramatically altered by climate change [@bradshaw_evolutionary_2006]. Specifically, spring has advanced and the growing season has lengthened. Organism responses include earlier breeding in animals such as birds and butterflies, earlier arrival of migratory birds, and earlier flowering in plants [@walther_ecological_2002]. Recent evidence also suggests that shifts in phenology may affect both the need and opportunity for other responses to climate change -- such as range shifts -- by stabilising temperature during critical and thermally-sensitive life events like nesting [@socolar_phenological_2017]. Similar changes in phenology are less clear in the tropics, where seasonality is less marked generally and less directly associated with climate change, and where long-term phenological monitoring is lacking [@corlett_impacts_2011]. Changes in rainy seasons and the timing of El Ni&ntilde;o may be interesting avenues for further research in this area.
    
#### Dispersal and movement

Over short timescales, arguably the easiest and most effective response to unsuitable climatic conditions at coarse spatial scales is for species to move towards suitable climatic conditions that manifest at finer spatial scales -- 'microrefugia' [@hannah_fine-grain_2014; @maclean_fine-scale_2017]. At the micro- scale (mm to m), microrefugia provide a 'microclimate' that deviates from the climate at the level of the whole habitat (m to ha; meso- or local scale). Heterogeneity at this scale is related to variation in slope and aspect [@suggitt_habitat_2011; @maclean_fine-scale_2017], as well as the presence of vegetation [@oke_boundary_1987] and features such as rocks, leaf litter, deadwood and tree holes, commonly referred to as 'microhabitats' [@scheffers_microhabitats_2014]. Paleoecological evidence suggests that refugia at various spatial scales have been instrumental in allowing species to persist through global and regional shifts in climate, and are important for explaining modern day species distributions [@hannah_fine-grain_2014; @stewart_refugia_2010]. Mobile species commonly utilise microclimates within generations through thermoregulatory behaviour of individuals, for example possums in tropical Australia choose the coolest tree hollows in which to den [@isaac_microclimate_2008], and herpetofauna of Singapore occupy microrefugia that both warm more slowly and more rarely exceed thermal limits than the wider macroclimate [@scheffers_microhabitats_2014]. Immobile species utilise microclimates indirectly, according to fine-scale differences in fitness [@maclean_microclimates_2015]. Microrefugia are unlikely to support species indefinitely within areas that become climatatically unsuitable at coarser scales, but the disconnect between climate at coarse and fine spatial scales means that microrefugia could buffer species from change [@maclean_fine-scale_2017; @scheffers_microhabitats_2014], allowing more time for other responses to manifest, such as genetic adaptation or physiological plasticity.

Until the recent 'revolution' in climate-change biology, microclimate research had been somewhat neglected [@hannah_fine-grain_2014]. A substantial limiting factor had been the ability to measure climate both at fine resolution and with broad coverage [@potter_microclimatic_2013], which is now made possible with the advent of affordable dataloggers, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and thermal imaging cameras [@scheffers_extreme_2017; @faye_toolbox_2016]. There remains a great deal of untapped potential for thermography in ecology, in part because there is little guidance on how to process the images and what metrics are of primary interest for thermal biology [@faye_toolbox_2016]. In \autoref{ch3} I present a basic `R` package, `ThermStats`, that simplifies the processing of images from FLIR thermal cameras, and calculates a variety of biologically-relevant metrics from any gridded temperature data.

Whether microclimates allow species to persist through climate change in local refugia, or simply give more time for other responses to manifest, a critical unknown is the influence of land-use change. Changes in vegetation structure through land-use change are likely to affect not only the average temperature [\autoref{ch2}; @senior_pantropical_2017], but also the availability and distribution of microclimates. For example, overall structural simplification and loss of microhabitats associated with large, old trees [e.g. deadwood and tree holes; @ball_tree_1999; @blakely_tree_2008] is likely to decrease the number and buffering potential of cool microclimates. This topic is addressed in \autoref{ch4}. Using fine-scale temperature and microhabitat data collected in logged and unlogged forests on Borneo, I tested the hypothesis that selective logging decreases thermal buffering potential, with associated consequences for conservation under future climate change.

### Range shifts

We have already seen that movement operates at fine spatial scales to allow species to persist in habitats that are considered to be unsuitable at coarser scales; eventually, however, mesoscale climate change will be felt even within microclimates, and for some species in situ adaptation will become insufficient -- to avoid extinction, the only remaining option is for species' to shift their ranges to track favourable climates. Range shifts are largely thought to occur through net population extinctions at the trailing edge, and/or net population colonisations at the leading edge [@parmesan_poleward_1999]. Range shifts within a generation may also occur via individual dispersal in highly mobile species [REF]. In temperate regions there is evidence for both latitudinal and altitudinal shifts in response to rising temperatures [@hill_responses_2002; @parmesan_poleward_1999; @thomas_birds_1999], while the latter is much more commonly observed in the tropics owing to shallow temperature gradients over latitude [@parmesan_ecological_2006; @colwell_global_2008]. For a given area of habitat, tropical rainforests also offer a diverse and expansive amount of vertical habitat [@scheffers_increasing_2013; @scheffers_vertical_2017; @scheffers_tropical_2018], which may prove to be an additional and significant temperature gradient for range-shifting tropical species. 

Facilitating climate-driven range shifts is increasingly acknowledged as important for enhancing climate resilience. There are several factors that influence whether range shifts will work for a given species:

(1) Availability of analogous climate -- is there available habitat with a similar climate to that of the species' current distribution?
(2) Accessibility of analogous climate -- is there a feasible route to habitat with analogous climate? 
(3) Traits of the focal species -- can the species of interest actually utilise available routes to reach habitat with analogous climate, and does it need to?

Previous studies have tended to use Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to answer the first of these, using the relationship between climate (among other things) and species' current distribution to predict which areas will be climatically suitable under future climate change [@hijmans_ability_2006]. Several studies consider the connectedness of suitable habitat without considering whether that habitat will remain climatically suitable [@tucker_moving_2018; @cosgrove_consequences_2017]. Increasingly studies are beginning to combine these approaches to ask whether habitat is sufficiently connected along climate gradients to facilitate rage shifts, hereafter referred to as 'climate connectivity' [@lawler_projected_2013; @mcguire_achieving_2016; @littlefield_connecting_2017]. In \autoref{ch5} I combine global tree cover and temperature data to quantify climate connectivity across the whole of the tropics, and to assess how climate connectivity has changed with recent deforestation.

## Thesis aims and rationale

The main aims of this thesis are to determine how land-use change in the tropics impacts (1) exposure to local warming, and (2) the feasbility of microclimates and of (3) range shifts as mechanisms for species to avoid extinction under climate change. I begin by collating data from the literature to compare local, site-level temperature data across different land-use types across the tropics. I then develop metrics and software to assess microclimates in the field using thermal images, which -- in combination with dataloggers and microhabitat measurements -- I use to compare thermal buffering potential of selectively logged and primary forests of Borneo. Finally, I use pantropical forest cover and climate datasets to consider how recent forest loss has impacted species' ability to track climate change by shifting their ranges. In the [General Discussion](#ch6) I synthesise all results to provide an overall picture of how land-use change in the tropics impacts species responses to climate change, and provide recommendations for action and further research. The specific objectives of the main data chapters are outlined below:

### [Chapter 2](#ch2) -- A pantropical analysis of the impacts of forest degradation and conversion on local temperature {-}

The recent surge in studies assessing impacts of climate warming on biodiversity hints at the importance of temperature for species' ecology. We also recognise land-use change as the main driver of biodiversity loss, mediated in a large part by changes to vegetation structure, which also giverns climate at a local scale (< 1 ha). Considering interactions with climate change, previous studies tend to focus on greenhouse gas emissions from conversion or barriers to range shifts. This chapter instead considers how land-use change directly causes local warming, thereby increasing the baseline temperature onto which climate change is added. By comparing site-level data from the literature, the main objectives of this chapter were to: (1) compare local temperature in different land-use types across the tropics, and (2) assess whether results were consistent between wet and dry seasons and above-ground compared to below-ground.

### [Chapter 3](#ch3) -- A framework for quantifying fine-scale thermal heterogeneity in the field {-}

It is increasingly acknowledged that most terrestrial biodiversity experiences temperature at much finer spatial scales and much nearer to the ground than is represented by coarse-scale climate research (> 1 km). Microclimate research is gaining traction, but has in part been neglected because of technological limitations in measuring temperature at a fine scale (mm to m). Thermal cameras are an increasingly affordable and practical means to measure microclimates, but the tecnology and data remain underutilised. The objectives of this chapter were to: (1) provide a simple `R` package to streamline the processing of thermal images from FLIR cameras, and (2) to suggest and facilitate calculation of key metrics for research into thermal hetereogeneity, using any gridded temperature data.

### [Chapter 4](#ch4) -- Tropical forests are thermally buffered despite intensive selective logging {-}

Temperature variation at a fine spatial scale allows species to cope with suboptimal temperatures at a coarser scale, leading many to suggest that microclimates may be increasingly important under climate change. Simultaneously, selective logging affects a huge area of the tropics, particularly in Southeast Asia, but we do not know how land-use change impacts microclimates. Combining temperature data from dataloggers and thermal images with microhabitat assessments, this chapter compares various components of thermal buffering between intensively logged and unlogged forests of Borneo. The main objectives were to test whether selective logging affected: (1) the difference between temperature at coarse (m to ha) and fine scales (mm to m); (2) the thermal stability of microclimates; and (3) the availability of microclimates to organisms.

### [Chapter 5](#ch5) -- Global loss of climate connectivity in tropical forests {-}

In addition to *in situ* adaptation, or where such adaptation is insufficient, species may shift their ranges at coarse scale in response to climate change. Range shifting is well-documented in both modern times and paleontological records, but its ubiqutiousness across the tropics as a means to prevent species from going extinct under climate change depends on species being able to reach suitable habitat with a suitable climate. No study to date has assessed the global connectivity of tropical forests to future climate analogues, nor investigated how this connectivity is affected by ongoing deforestation. This chapter utilises global climate and forest cover data to determine: (1) the extent to which current forest cover in the tropics facilitates movement to analogous future climate, and (2) how this has been impacted by recent changes in forest cover.
