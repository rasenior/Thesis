## Threats to biodiversity

* Global extinction crisis, caused by humans [@barnosky_has_2011]
    * Recent rates of extinction are between 100 and 1000 times greater than pre-human levels [@barnosky_has_2011; @pimm_future_1995]
    * Has not slowed despite increasing awareness and action [@butchart_global_2010]
* Main ways in which humans drive extinction
    * Land-use change, climate change, pollution, over-exploitation and invasive species [@hirsch_global_2010]
    * Greatest overall threat to terrestrial systems is currently land-use change, climate change is forecast to become increasingly important [@sala_global_2000]
* Why extinction matters
    * Intrinsic value [@mace_whose_2014]
    * Extrinsic value (ecosystem services) [@balmford_economic_2002; @costanza_value_1997]
    * Resilience [@oliver_declining_2015] and planetary boundaries [@rockstrom_safe_2009]
* Why the tropics are particularly important
    * Harbour most of the world's terrestrial biodiversity [@jenkins_global_2013]
    * Many species yet to be discovered [@scheffers_what_2012; @joppa_biodiversity_2011]
    * Remaining pristine habitat, on which a disproportionate number of species depend [REF]
* -> important to understand how biodiversity responds to human impacts, and how we can support adaptive responses to prevent extinction

## Land-use change in the tropics

* Tropics is undergoing a huge amount of land-use change, which historically was concentrated more in temperate regions [@gibbs_tropical_2010; @foley_solutions_2011]
* Land-use change has driven extensive and severe losses of biodiversity across the planet [@newbold_global_2015]

### Forest conversion

* Driven primarily by agriculture [@godfray_food_2010]
* Devastating loss of habitat, particularly in SE Asia and Amazon [@gibbs_tropical_2010; @hansen_high-resolution_2013]
* Greenhouse gas emission [@foley_global_2005; @ipcc_climate_2013]
* Secondary impacts: roads, edge effects, fragmentation [@laurance_impacts_2009; @murcia_edge_1995; @pfeifer_creation_2017; @ewers_fragmentation_2013]

### Forest degradation

* Includes fragmentation and edge effects (see above), as well as selective logging 
* Wholesale conversion is very likely to impede the ability of persisting organisms to adapt to future climate change, but then few of the original species do persist through conversion [e.g. @gibson_primary_2011; @katovai_understory_2012; @murphy_meta-analysis_2014] and, in the tropics, habitat degradation is far more pervasive
    * 20% of the humid tropical biome experienced selective logging from 2000-2005 [@asner_contemporary_2009], whilst deforestation affected only 1.4% in the same period [@hansen_humid_2008].
    * Selective logging more extensive esp. in SE Asia [@hansen_humid_2008; @asner_contemporary_2009]
* Although the habitat type broadly remains as 'forest', selective logging can be extremely disruptive
    * The term 'selective' is somewhat of a misnomer, meaning that particular species and stems (usually above a minimum trunk diameter) are targeted [@edwards_maintaining_2014]
    * These targets are typically the largest, oldest trees, the removal of which reduces canopy height and canopy density [@kumar_effects_2005; @okuda_effect_2003], and also fragments the forest canopy and opens up large gaps [@edwards_maintaining_2014] that are often invaded by non-tree species, such as climbers and bamboo
    * Commercial selective logging also causes collateral damage, particularly where trees are connected by climbers [@schnitzer_recruitment_2004], as well as requiring roads and skid trails that bring further challenges for wildlife [@brodie_correlation_2014; @laurance_global_2014], and heavy machinery that result in soil compaction [@putz_reduced-impact_2008]
* The impact of habitat degradation on species' ability to persist under climate change is likely to be less profound than under wholesale conversion, simply because the amount of habitat change is less. However, a greater proportion of species found in undisturbed habitat remain in degraded habitat than in converted habitat, and it is these species that are of primary conservation concern [@edwards_degraded_2011; @gibson_primary_2011; @edwards_biodiversity_2013]
* Furthermore, degraded forests now represent a significant proportion of the humid tropical biome, and are therefore home to a significant proportion of all tropical forest species on Earth. 
* Many tropical species will need to adapt to additional threats, such as climate change, within degraded forest, hence a pragmatic conservation approach is to maximise the ability of degraded forests to sustain biodiversity under these threats [@maxwell_biodiversity:_2016]

## Climate change in the tropics

* Can be directly caused by land-use change at the local scale (set scene for chapter 2)
* Debate about vulnerability of tropical species
* Vulnerability is about both exposure (extrinsic factors) and sensitivity (intrinsic factors) [@williams_towards_2008]
* Exposure and senstivity interact to determine whether species _need_ to resist or recover from perturbations, as well as their _ability_ to do so
* It is likely that most tropical species _will_ need to respond to the effects of climate change in some way
    * Exposure in terms of absolute change will be less than elsewhere [@corlett_impacts_2011; @corlett_climate_2012; @ipcc_climate_2013], but long periods of climatic stability mean that exposure in terms of relative change will likely be greatest in the tropics, with the earliest appearance of novel climates [@mora_projected_2013]
    * Following limited temperature variation -- over space (shallow latitudinal temperature gradients [@colwell_global_2008]), and time (geologic and seasonally [@williams_towards_2008]) -- tropical species tend to have narrow thermal limits [@deutsch_impacts_2008; @tewksbury_putting_2008; @khaliq_global_2014], and already operate near the upper limits of these [@deutsch_impacts_2008; @tewksbury_putting_2008]
* Where species do adaptively respond to climate change to avoid extinction, they can adapt in situ or shift their range to track shifting climate

### In situ adaptation

#### Genetic adaptation

* Evidence for genetic adaptation is limited
* Major evolution at the species level is not evident in the fossil record during the Pleistocene glaciation event, even though this comprised climate change of 5-10 times the magnitude of 20th Century warming [@parmesan_ecological_2006]
* Many of the tropical species of particular global conservation interest are highly specialised; specialisation tends to reduce variation in heritable traits and therefore decreases potential for genetic adaptation [@williams_towards_2008]
* Genetic adpaptation of thermal tolerance directly is more common for lower thermal limits; given that temperatures are globally predicted to rise, it is acute or chronic exposure to temperatures above upper thermal limits that will likely have the biggest negative impacts on individuals and populations [REF]
* More evidence for genetic adaptation of traits that underlie other adaptive responses: namely, physiological plasticity or dispersal ability
    * Dutch great tits that display greater plasticity in their timing of reproduction are better able to match egg-laying to food availability – the peak of which has advanced as a result of climate change – and thus achieve greater fitness [@nussey_selection_2005]
    * Increase flight capacity in British butterflies and grasshoppers [REF]
* There are also practical explanations for the lack of documented evolutionary responses, since these adaptations are less intuitive and harder to document than ecological responses [@oconnor_toward_2012]

#### Physiological plasticity

* Evidence for physiological plasticity is widespread, although it tends to be limited to phenological changes rather than thermal tolerance directly [@parmesan_ecological_2006]
* Commonly observed in temperate regions of the Northern hemisphere, where seasonality is the overarching determinant of species' phenology, and is itself dramatically altered by climate change [@bradshaw_evolutionary_2006]
    * Spring has advanced and the growing season has lengthened
    * Organism responses include earlier breeding in animals such as birds and butterflies, earlier arrival of migratory birds, and earlier flowering in plants [@walther_ecological_2002]
* In the tropics, may be changes in phenology associated with changes in rainy seasons or El Ni&ntilde;o
    
#### Dispersal and movement

* Over short timescales in particular, arguably the easiest and most effective response to unsuitable climatic conditions at coarse spatial scales is for species to move towards suitable climatic conditions that manifest at finer spatial scales -- 'microrefugia'
    * At the micro- scale (mm to cm), microrefugia provide a 'microclimate' that deviates from the climate at the level of the whole habitat (m to ha; meso- or local scale)
    * Climatic heterogeneity at the micro-scale scale is related to variation in slope and aspect [@suggitt_habitat_2011; @maclean_fine-scale_2017], as well as the presence of vegetation [@oke_boundary_1987] and features such as rocks, leaf litter, deadwood and tree holes, commonly referred to as 'microhabitats' [@scheffers_microhabitats_2014]
* Paleoecological evidence suggests that refugia at various spatial scales have been instrumental in allowing species to persist through global and regional shifts in climate, and are important for explaining modern day species distributions [REF]
* In the present day, mobile species commonly utilise microclimates within generations through thermoregulatory behaviour of indvidiuals
    * Moose in boreal forests of Finland seek out the cooler microclimates of forests with higher and denser canopies, in response to high daytime temperatures [@melin_moose_2014]
    * In the tropics, possums choose the coolest tree hollows in which to den [@isaac_microclimate_2008], and herpetofauna of Singapore occupy microrefugia that not only largely avoid their critical thermal maxima (CT~max~) –- which is often exceeded in the wider macroclimate –- but their microrefugia also heat less quickly than the macroclimate [@scheffers_microhabitats_2014]
    * Immobile species utilise microclimates indirectly, according to fine-scale differences in fitness [@maclean_microclimates_2015]
* It is highly likely that microclimates will be play a significant role in species' responses to present climate change
    * Microclimates may have been overlooked in the past because measuring climate at the level of individuals requires technology that has only become available and affordable relatively recently (set scene for chapter 3) 
    * Microrefugia are unlikely to support species indefinitely within areas that become unsuitable at coarser scales, but the disconnect between climate at coarse and fine spatial scales means that microrefugia could buffer species from change [@maclean_fine-scale-2017; @scheffers_microhabitats_2014], allowing more time for other responses to manifest, such as genetic adaptation or physiological plasticity
* We do not know the extent to which land-use change impacts microclimates and their ability to buffer species from suboptimal climate at the coarser scale (set scene for chaper 4)
    * It is possible that microclimates could be entirely removed as a consequence of microhabitat removal [e.g. loss of some bird's nest fern species upon conversion of forest to oil palm plantation; @fayle_effect_2009] or extreme macroclimate warming [@caillon_warming_2014]

### Range shifts

* We have already seen that movement operates at fine spatial scales to allow species to persist in habitats that are considered to be unsuitable at coarser scales; eventually, however, mesoscale climate change will be felt even within microclimates, and for some species in situ adaptation will become insufficient -- to avoid extinction, the only remaining option is for species' to shift their ranges to track favourable climates
* Commonly range shifts are thought to occur through net population extinctions at the trailing edge, and/or net population colonisations at the leading edge [@parmesan_poleward_1999]
    * Dispersal by individuals may also occur in highly mobile species [REF]
* Prevalence globally and tropically of range-shifting as a response to climate change, particularly polewards or upwards to counteract rising temperatures 
* Until recently, most evidence came from temperature and boreal regions:
    * In the Arctic, shrubs and red foxes have expanded polewards [@hersteinsson_interspecific_1992; @sturm_climate_2001]
    * Both latitudinal and altitudinal shifts have been seen in birds and butterflies of temperate regions [@hill_responses_2002; @parmesan_poleward_1999; @thomas_birds_1999]
* In the tropics, climate gradients across latitude are very shallow, which would require organisms to shift over vast distances to achieve a given change in temperature [@colwell_global_2008]
    * There is, however, growing evidence that tropical species move to higher elevations under climate warming [@chen_elevation_2009; @pounds_biological_1999]
    * For a given area of habitat, tropical rainforests also offer a diverse and expansive amount of vertical habitat [@scheffers_increasing_2013; @scheffers_vertical_2017; @scheffers_tropical_2018]
* While tropical species do appear to track climate more closely than temperate species [@freeman_rapid_2014], they do not track climate precisely [@chen_elevation_2009] and there are various factors that influence the strength of this relationship:
    * Availability of target habitat -- is there habitat with analogous climate?
    * Accessbility of taget habitat -- is there a route to habitat with analogous climate?
    * Ecological traits of the focal species -- can the species of interest actually utilise the route to reach analogous climate? Does it need to (can it adapt in situ)?
* Many studies focus on availability of climate analogues, or present day connectedness of natural habitat, without considering the two things simultaenously (set scene for chapter 5)
    * This is likely to be highly impacted by land-use change, which we have already seen affects both the quantity, quality and connectedness of tropical rainforests

## Thesis aims and rationale

1. Investigate the potential for land-use change to impact microclimates and microhabitats, and hence the subsequent impacts on:
    * The baseline of local climate change that global climate change is projected onto (Ch2)
    * The potential for thermal buffering as an adaptive response (Ch3 and Ch4)
2. Investigate the potential for land-use change to impact range shifts under climate change (Ch5)

* Focus on the tropics
* First use a literature review to collect local site-level temperature data in different land-use types across the tropics
* Develop methodology and software to utilise thermal images as a tool for assessing thermal heterogeneity
* Then consider temperature and temperature variation at an even finer scale, using a field study in Borneo
* Finally, use pantropical forest cover and climate datasets to consider how recent forest loss has impacted species' ability to track climate change by shifting their ranges

The specific objectives of the main data chapters are outlined below:

### Chapter 2 -- A pantropical analysis of the impacts of forest degradation and conversion on local temperature

* Many studies considering impacts of climate change hint at the importance of temperature for species' ecology
* When considering interactions between land-use change and global climate change, most studies tend to focus on how the former may cause or hinder adaptation to the latter
* This chapter focused on how degradation and conversion of tropical forests directly causes climate change, on a fine spatiotemporal scale
* Implications for the impact of further warming under global climate change, but suggests that degraded forests and microhabitats may be able to buffer species from further change

### Chapter 3 -- A framework for quantifying fine-scale thermal heterogeneity in the field

* Despite acknowledged importance of temperature for species' ecology, and recognition that most species experience temperature at a the spatial scale of mm to m, focus on fine-scale temperature regimes has been much neglected in ecology
* Part of the reason is limitations in technology, although such limitations are being increasingly overcome
* Dataloggers -> thermal cameras 
* The focus of this chapter is to develop a framework and software for utilising thermography to quantify thermal heterogeneity at a fine spatial scale using images collected in the field
* We present a developmental R package and worked example, demonstrating the utility of the package for comparing thermal heteogeneity over time between different locations

### Chapter 4 -- Tropical forests are thermally buffered despite intensive selective logging

* Temperature variation at a fine spatial scale is crutially important in allowing species to cope with temperature change at a coarser scale
* Selective logging affects a huge area of tropical rainforests, particularly in SE Asia, but we do not know how this form of land-use change impacts fine-scale temperature
* Using data collected in Borneo, this chapter compares various components of thermal buffering between intensively logged and unlogged forests, and finds little thermal difference despite lingering differences in forest structure
* Confirms results hinted at in Chapter 2, underscoring the conservation value of degraded forests particularly when left to recover

### Chapter 5 -- The impact of recent forest cover change on climate connectivity in the tropics

* In addition to in situ adaptation, or where such adaptation is insufficient, species may shift their ranges at coarse scale in response to climate change
* Range shifting is well-documented in both modern times and paleontological records, but its ubiqutiousness across the tropics as a means to prevent species from going extinct under climate change depends on species being able to reach suitable habitat with a suitable climate
* This chapter utilises global climate and forest cover data to assess the extent to which current forest cover facilitates movement to analogous future climate, and how this has been impacted by recent changes in forest cover
* Find that climate connectivity is very poor in many regions of the tropics, and has largely declined over just 12 years of forest loss
