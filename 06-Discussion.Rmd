## Summary of thesis findings

The main aims of this thesis were to determine how land-use change in the tropics impacts (1) exposure to local warming, and the feasibility of both (2) microclimates and of (3) range shifts as mechanisms by which species can avoid extinction under global climate change. First, I compared local, site-level temperature in various different land-use types using field data collated from the literature. I went on to develop a framework and R package to facilitate assessment of fine-scale (mm to m) thermal heterogeneity using thermal images, which I combined with temperature dataloggers and microhabitat assessments to compare the potential for thermal buffering in logged and unlogged forests on Borneo. Even with thermal buffering the distribution of many species will shift as the climate warms, hence I used global forest cover and climate datasets to quantify, across the tropics, the extent to which range shifts to analogous future climates are facilitated by existing forest cover, and how this has changed in recent years. In the following chapter I synthesise all my results to illustrate how, overall, the loss and degradation of forests has impacted species' ability to respond to future climate change in the tropics. I conclude with recommendations for conservation practitioners and policy-makers, and some suggestions for priority research directions.

### Climate at the fine scale

Until recently most studies of climate change impacts used very coarse resolution climate data -- up to 10,000 times greater than the size of the organism in question [@potter_microclimatic_2013] -- and have not well integrated the combined effects of land-use change and climate change [@titeux_global_2017]. The findings of [Chapter 2](#ch2) highlight that coarse data can mask important anthropogenic impacts at the level of the organism. Namely, that in many parts of the tropics where forest has been lost, extreme warming has already occurred as a result. I also found that degraded forests and below-ground habitat avoided local warming through land-use change, although [Chapter 2](#ch2) did not consider temperature at the micro-scale (mm to m; 'microclimates') that allows mobile organisms to behaviourally thermoregulate [@scheffers_microhabitats_2014; @gonzalez_del_pliego_thermally_2016], and can even influence fine-scale distribution of less mobile organisms [@maclean_fine-scale_2017]. 

Capturing micro-scale, biologically-relevant temperature data has become increasingly feasbile with the advent of tiny dataloggers and affordable thermal imaging technology [@scheffers_extreme_2017]. The latter has, however, been underutilised at least in part because there is little guidance available for processing and anlysing thermal images in ecology. I addressed this shortfall in [Chapter 3](#ch3), where I presented a developmental 'R' package -- `ThermStats` -- designed to streamline the processing of images from FLIR thermal cameras, and also capable of calculating key metrics of thermal hetereogeneity for any gridded temperature data. 

In [Chapter 4](#ch4) I built on the findings of [Chapter 2](#ch2) by assessing microclimate availability and buffering capacity in intensively selected logged forests on Borneo, compared to nearby unlogged, primary forest. Using techniques developed in [Chapter 3](#ch3), combined with dataloggers and microhabitat measurements, I found that not only are degraded forests and primary forests comparable in local temperature (cf. [Chapter 2](#ch2)), but microclimates are also similar in availability, thermal stability and ability to buffer organisms from local warming at coarser spatial scales. 

### Climate at the coarse scale

Chapters 2 to 4 focused on the impact of land-use change on temperature at spatial scales of millimetres to hectares which, in the context of climate change, is important for understanding the baseline temperature onto which global climate warming is projected, as well as the likely ability of organisms to utilise microclimates as a means to avoid suboptimal temperatures at coarser spatial scales. However, even where microrefugia are available, and especially where they are not, global climate change may impact temperature at all spatial scales to the extent that organisms will need longer-term solutions to avoid extinction [@hannah_fine-grain_2014]. Range shifts are one such solution, and have been widely documented [@parmesan_ecological_2006]. In [Chapter 5](#ch5) I found that tropical forests are generally poorly connected along climate gradients, such that the average tropical forest will fail to facilitate species' range shifts to analogous future climates. Increasing loss of forest lead to an accelerating loss of climate connectivity, suggesting that without intervention the current situation could decline rapidly.  

## Wider applicability of findings

### Biological relevance

The results of Chapters 2 to 4 are most relevant for small-bodied ectotherms, which are strongly influenced by local and fine-scale temperature, and are widely known to utilise thermal variation at these spatial scales to avoid suboptimal climatic conditions at coarser scales [@scheffers_microhabitats_2014; @gonzalez_del_pliego_thermally_2016]. Small-bodied animals are more strongly influenced by surface temperatures and boundary layer climates [e.g. @kaspari_thermal_2015] so our results are also relevant for small-bodied endotherms, although less is known about the extent to which they can and do utilise microclimates in tropical rainforests. While immobile species cannot directly utilise microclimates within generations, their fitness may still be affected by local temperature and by changes in fine-scale thermal heterogeneity, the latter potentially driving dispersal between generations and causing individuals to localise within particular microclimates [@maclean_microclimates_2015]. 

The findings of [Chapter 5](#ch5) are most immediately relevant for species that can disperse easily but require forest cover to do so, such as medium to large-sized, non-volant forest specialists [cf. @nunez_connectivity_2013]. The size of these organisms makes microclimates a less viable way to avoid climate warming in the long term, but also enhances their ability to disperse to more favourable climates. Poorer dispersers may be unable to keep pace with changing climate [@schloss_dispersal_2012], requiring additional mechanisms to avoid extinction such as microrefugia or physiological plasticity.

A key consideration for future research is water balance. Water has a higher specific heat capacity than air, requiring a greater input of thermal energy to achieve the same change in temperature. Increased water avilability also increases evapotranspiration, meaning that thermal energy is dissipated through the evaporation of water rather than a change in temperature [@oke_boundary_1987]. Water balance is particularly important for amphibians because their semi-permeable skin makes them prone to dessication when temperatures are high [@duellman_biology_1986]. A particularly useful metric in this context is vapour pressure deficit -- the difference between the amount of moisture in the air and how much moisture the air can hold when it is saturated -- which can be measured at fine spatial scales using dataloggers that record both temperature and relative humidity. These dataloggers are still prone to water damage [@bramer_advances_2018], but nevertheless provide valuable information for quantifying microclimates. At coarser spatial scales, precipitation could provide a valuable extension to the approach of [Chapter 5](#ch5). This is best applied at regional scale where future projections are more reliable and there is a clearer gradient that species would need to follow to avoid deleterious changes in precipitation. 

Regardless of spatial scale I have only focused on species movement in two dimensions. In reality, tropical rainforests also have a high degree of structural complexity in the third dimension, providing an additional climate gradient that species could exploit to cope with global climate warming [@scheffers_tropical_2018; @scheffers_vertical_2017]. With ever-improving technology, it is possible to apply the techniques of [Chapter 3](#ch3) and [Chapter 4](#ch4) vertically and in forests of varying human impact to create a fuller, more three-dimensional overview of how human activity affects thermal regimes in tropial forests. Thermal data could be collected more extensively uing LiDAR [@jucker_topography_2018], by combining thermal imagery with unmanned aerial vehicles [@faye_toolbox_2016; @sanchez-azofeifa_twenty-first_2017], or by combining telemetry and dataloggers to record and recreate the thermal experiences of large, mobile species. Detailed ground-truthed data could be combined with with above-canopy, remotely sensed data in correlative or mechanistic models [cf. @maclean_fine-scale_2017; @kearney_nichemapr_2016] to create sub-canopy climate layers, potentially feeding into Species Distribution Models or to understand other climate change responses, such as local adaptation and acclimation.

### Relevance across tropics and elsewhere

Chapters 2 and 5 had the broadest geographical relevance, since they were pan-tropical in scope. The representativeness of [Chapter 2](#ch2) was limited by the availability of temperature data in the literature, with Africa being particularly poorly represented. [Chapter 5](#ch5) considered only the effects of wholesale forest conversion, while [Chapter 4](#ch4) only forest degradation by selective logging. Additionally, [Chapter 4](#ch4) focused on a region of the tropics where logging intensity had been among the highest globally [@lewis_increasing_2015] but had recently ceased entirely [@reynolds_changes_2011]. Applying the approaches of Chapters 4 and 5 to different modes of land-use change, of varying intensity and periods of recovery, would yield a fuller appreciation of how changes to forest cover impact thermal buffering by microclimates and the feasibility of range shifts. 

This thesis focuses on tropical rainforests, but there are many priority regions for conservation where natural vegetation is not closed canopy forest -- for example, Brazil's cerrado and the Succulent Karoo of South Africa and Namibia [@myers_biodiversity_2000]. In these places, modification by humans is less likely to vastly alter local and fine-scale temperature because there is naturally less thermal buffering by complex, three-dimensional vegetation. That is not to say that a small change in absolute temperature would not have ecological implications, since this depends on the ecology of inhabitant species and their sensitivity to temperature change. The specific structures associated with microclimates will undoubtedly vary by location, e.g. desert burrows and alpine boulder fields [@shoo_potential_2010]. Climate connectivity is likely to be poor for many habitat types because of widespread habitat loss and resulting fragmentation. More intact regions tend to be those that are inhospitable to humans, such as taiga and deserts [@watson_catastrophic_2016] and regions at very high elevation [@elsen_global_2018]. In these places, climate connectivity will be largely determined by the availability of analogous future climate, and this is more likely in areas of high topographic complexity [@elsen_global_2015].

## Recommendations for conservation

Land-use change is still the primary cause of species loss [@sala_global_2000], and the lack of consideration of associated climatic effects suggests that its full impact may be underestimated and potentially confounded with climate change [@oliver_interactions_2014]. As a growing driver of biodiversity loss, it is necessary to consider climate change and mitigate against it, but the priority for conservation research, practice and policy should -- first and foremost -- be to minimise land-use change and its negative consequences. A growing body of evidence suggests that a land sparing approach is often the best way to maximise biodiversity retention, whether the land use is agriculture [@phalan_reconciling_2011], selective logging [@edwards_land-sparing_2015] or urban development [REF]. Payments for Ecosystem Services may also be used to incentivise forest protection and restoration. 

On a local scale, enhancing thermal heterogeneity could increase the potential for thermal buffering, potentially protecting species from climate change or, at the very least, providing more time for adaptation and dispersal [@hannah_fine-grain_2014]. [Chapter 4](#ch4) demonstrates that forest regeneration over a decade is sufficient for thermal recovery in the forest understorey after intensive selective logging. More research is needed to identify the minimum recovery time needed, but it may be that active restoration or reduced impact logging cold bolster thermal recovery even further. One possible approach is *in situ* management of vegetation structure, reviewed in @greenwood_using_2016. It would be insightful to experiment with such interventons in different land-use types in the tropics, with impacts on fine-scale thermal heterogeneity assessed using dataloggers and/or thermal imagery (cf. Chapters 3 and 4) and a simulatenous assessment of the impact on local biodiversity. 

At regional and global scales, [Chapter 5](#ch5) outlined the importance of connecting tropical forest along climate gradients to facilitate species range shifts under future climate change. Reforestation is in line with the Bonn Challenge, which seeks to restore 350 million hectares by 2030, while further forest protection would contribute to Aichi target 11, whereby at least 17% of terrestrial and inland water areas are protected by 2020 [REF]. A simple way to connect forest along climate gradients is to focus on elevational gradients, which are currently poorly connected [@elsen_global_2018]. The results in [Chapter 5](#ch5) can also be used to signpost to hotspots of poor climate connectivity, which would benefit for more targeted research at a finer spatial resolutions and potentially refined for priority habitat types or taxa. 
    
## Conclusions

The influence of ongoing degradation and conversion of tropical forests on the ability of species to respond to climate change will have a major influence on the long-term prospects for tropical forest specialists. Tropical species represent a large, valuable and vulnerable pool of global biodiversity, the loss of which would invariably push us towards, and perhaps beyond, various plantery boundaries. Land-use change can directly and substantially alter local climate, but degraded forests and microhabitats are valuable assets to conservation through their ability to buffer species from climate warming at coarser spatial scales. Forest protection and restoration can also help connect species to future climate analogues, which most tropical forests currently fail to do. To maximise climate resilience of tropical rainforests, practitoners and policy-makers should maximise the options available for species to respond to climate: minimising forest loss, permitting and even facilitating the recovery of degraded forests, and planning forest loss, gain and restoration with climate gradients in mind.
