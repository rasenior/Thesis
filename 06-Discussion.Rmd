## Summary of thesis findings

The main aims of this thesis were to determine how land-use change in the tropics impacts (1) exposure to local warming, and the feasibility of both (2) microclimates and of (3) range shifts as mechanisms by which species can avoid extinction under global climate change. First, I compared local, site-level temperature in various different land-use types using field data collated from the literature. I went on to develop a framework and R package to facilitate assessment of fine-scale (mm to m) thermal heterogeneity using thermal images, which I combined with temperature dataloggers and microhabitat assessments to compare the potential for thermal buffering in logged and unlogged forests on Borneo. Even with thermal buffering the distribution of many species will shift as the climate warms, hence I used global forest cover and climate datasets to quantify, across the tropics, the extent to which range shifts to analogous future climates are facilitated by existing forest cover, and how this has changed in recent years. In this final chapter I synthesise the results from each chapter to illustrate how, overall, the loss and degradation of forests has impacted species' ability to respond to future climate change in the tropics. I conclude with recommendations for conservation practitioners and policy-makers, and some suggestions for future research directions.

**[Chapter 2](#ch2) -- A pantropical analysis of the impacts of forest degradation and conversion on local temperature** 

__Main objectives:__

1. Compare local temperature in different land-use types across the tropics.
2. Assess whether results were consistent between wet and dry seasons and above-ground compared to below-ground.

Using site-level temperature data collated from the literature, I found that in both wet and dry seasons forest conversion directly and profoundly influences local climate even before future global climate change is taken into account. Local warming was, however, not evident in degraded forests or below-ground. Thus, species persisting in deforested land have already experienced substantial warming, and are likely to be at greater risk under future climate change than non-forest species. Degraded forests and microhabitats may be capable of buffering species from such change, and could therefore be important assests within a landscape for maximising climate resilience at local and regional scales.

**[Chapter 3](#ch3) -- A framework for quantifying fine-scale thermal heterogeneity using thermography** 

__Main objectives:__ 

1. Provide a simple `R` package to streamline the processing of thermal images from FLIR thermal cameras.
2. Suggest and facilitate the calculation of key metrics of thermal heterogeneity, for any gridded temperature data.

My `R` package `ThermStats` is publically available on GitHub (https://github.com/rasenior/ThermStats), and will be of particular use to researchers interested in using FLIR thermal cameras to quantify thermal heterogeneity in the field. I demonstrate its utility using two case studies. The first uses fine-scale data from FLIR thermal images to assess thermal heterogeneity over time and in logged and unlogged forests on Borneo. The second quantifies seasonal patterns in thermal heterogeneity on Borneo, using data from WorldClim2 at ~1 km^2^ resolution. For both fine- and coarse-scale data, I found strong temporal patterns in nearly all metrics of thermal heterogeneity.

**[Chapter 4](#ch4) -- Tropical forests are thermally buffered despite intensive selective logging** 

__Main objectives:__

1. Asssess the impact of commercial selective logging on the difference between temperature at coarse (m to ha) and fine scales (mm to m).
2. Investigate whether selectively logged and unlogged forests differ in the thermal stability and availability of microclimates.

Despite clear structural differences in intensively selectively logged forest and primary, unlogged forest on Borneo, I found very little difference between forest types in the availability of microclimates or their ability to buffer organism from warming of the habitat as a whole. This suggests a propensity for rapid thermal recovery in degraded forests, and highlights their long-term value for the conservation of temperature-sensitive forest specialists.

**[Chapter 5](#ch5) -- The impact of recent forest cover change on climate connectivity in the tropics**

__Main objectives:__

1. Determine the extent to which current forest cover in the tropics facilitates species movement to analogous future climate.
2. Assess how species' ability to reach future climate analogues has been impacted by recent changes in forest cover.

Combining global forest cover and climate datasets, we found that the ability of tropical forests to facilitate species range shifts under climate change was generally very poor, and rapidly declines with increasing loss of forest area. Many species will struggle to each analogous future climates given current levels of forest cover, so there is a need to prevent further forest loss where possible, and to reforest in key areas, such as along elevational gradients.

## Climate at the fine scale

Until recently most studies of climate change impacts have used very coarse resolution climate data -- up to 10,000 times greater than the size of the organism in question [@potter_microclimatic_2013] -- and have not well integrated the combined effects of land-use change and climate change [@titeux_global_2017]. The findings of [Chapter 2](#ch2) highlight that coarse data can mask important anthropogenic impacts at the level of the organism. Namely, that in many parts of the tropics where forest has been lost, extreme warming has already occurred. I also suggest that degraded forests and below-ground habitat avoid local warming through land-use change, although [Chapter 2](#ch2) did not consider the temperature at an even finer spatial scale (mm to m; 'microclimates') that allows mobile organisms to behaviourally thermoregulate [@scheffers_microhabitats_2014; @gonzalez_del_pliego_thermally_2016], and can even influence fine-scale distribution of less mobile organisms [@maclean_fine-scale_2017]. 

Capturing fine-scale, biologically-relevant temperature data has become increasingly feasbile with the advent of tiny dataloggers and affordable thermal imaging technology [@scheffers_extreme_2017]. The latter has, however, been underutilised at least in part because there is little guidance available for processing and anlysing thermal images in ecological research. I addressed this shortfall in [Chapter 3](#ch3), where I presented a developmental 'R' package -- `ThermStats` -- designed in particular for streamlining the processing of images from FLIR thermal cameras, but also capable of calculating key metrics of thermal hetereogeneity for all gridded temperature data. 

In [Chapter 4](#ch4) I built on the findings of [Chapter 2](#ch2) by assessing microclimate availability and buffering capacity in intensively selected logged forests on Borneo compared to nearby unlogged, primary forest. Using techniques developed in [Chapter 3](#ch3), alongside dataloggers and microhabitat measurements, I found that not only are degraded forests and primary forests comparable in local temperature (cf. [Chapter 2](#ch2)]), but microclimates are also similar in availability, thermal stability and ability to buffer organisms from local warming at coarser spatial scales. 

## Climate at the coarse scale

* Fine-scale climate is important for the day-to-day, individual-level responses of organisms to suboptimal temperatures, but over decades it is highly likely that many species will respond to coarse-scale climate change by shifting their ranges
    * This could happen alongside in situ adaptation, which could provide a buffer and allow more time for species to reach new target habitat
    * It could also be that in situ adaptation is not possible or is insufficient, for example in converted lands where the local temperature has increased to a level way beyond the thermal tolerance of forest specialists
* Chapter 4 considers the extent to which land-use change impacts landscape permeability, and the subsequent potential for species to reach analogous climates through natural habitat
    * Current levels of forest cover in the tropics offer poor connectivity between analogous climates, which has largely worsened from 2000 to 2012
* Only considering structural connectivity - no species data (this would make the approach species-specific and impose data limitations)
* Do not consider other climate variables, because their projections are uncertain and spatially variable, which makes it impossible at this stage to determine the gradient that species would have to follow to maintain climate parity

## Wider applicability of findings

### Biological relevance

<!-- * Bias towards particular regions & LUT -->
<!-- * Doesn't account for intensity -->
<!-- * Should also consider the vertical climate gradient in tropical rainforest [@scheffers_tropical_2018; @scheffers_vertical_2017] -->
<!-- WATER -->

* Chapters 2-4 are most relevant to small-bodied ectotherms, that are heavily influenced by local and fine-scale temperature and which are widely known to utilise thermal variation at this scale as a means to avoid suboptimal climatic conditions at a coarser scale
    * Also relevant to small-bodied endotherms, although less is known about the extent to which they can and do utilise microclimates in tropical forests
    * Could be relevant to plants, particuarly in early life stages e.g. germination
    * A need to consider how behavioural exploitation of fine-scale temperature variation interacts with local adaptation and acclimation, and coarser scale responses such as range shifts
* Chapter 5 is more relevant to larger and more mobile animal species, such as medium-sized mammals, which are perhaps less able to adapt in situ but likely to shift their ranges in response to climate change
    * Relevance to plants will also depend on ability to disperse across matrix
    * Unknowns about how forest itself will shift under climate change also influences the relevance of these results to forest specialists
    * Different kinds of forest, which will limit different species to differeng extents
    * Inclusion of tree plantations may not be appropriate for many forest specialists, since they tend to lack structural and biological diversity 
    
### Relevance across tropics and elsewhere

<!-- Vertical climate gradients -->
<!-- Other land use type, land use change and land use intensities -->

* Chapter 2 was pantropical, but Africa was poorly represented 
    * Where natural vegetation is not forest (e.g. parámo, cerrado, savannah, dessert), it is expected that land-use change will have a much less substantial impact on local temperature
* Chapter 4 focused on a region of the tropics where logging intensity has in the past been very severe, but where logging activity has since ceased
    * Less relevant to areas with ongoing intensive logging
    * Less relevant to areas where recovery of canopy cover has not been permitted or not possible
* Chapter 4 only focused on the understorey, but in vertically complex forests there may well me a different result above the understorey

## Recommendations for conservation and futher research

<!-- Linking different spatiotemporal scales -->
<!-- Combining technologies, data & techniques -->

* Land-use change is still a primary cause of species loss, and the lack of consideration of climatic impacts of land-use change may have underestimated this impact or caused it to be confounded with climate change (Chapter 2)
* Growing literature on the ways in which land-use change and climate change interact, but the impacts on risk of extinction for particular species will depend on many factors:
    * Spatiotemporal scale (Chapter 3 and 4)
    * Plasticity
    * Local adaptation
    * Functional connectivity (e.g. dispersal limits, metapopulation dynamics)
* On a local scale, enhancing thermal heterogeneity may help species to thermoregulate and so buffer species from climate change (at least offering them more time to adpat or disperse)
    * Chapter 4 suggests that natural resoration over a decade is sufficient for thermal recovery in the understorey, but this should be integrated with recovery of other abiotic and biotic requirements
    * More research is needed on the speed of thermal recovery, and whether active restoration or RIL techniques might have a role to play in enhancing thermal recovery from logging
    * What about other forms of land-use change?
* With improvements in technology, it would be fruitful to consider: 
    * Other climatic factors, particularly moisture, at a fine spatial scale
    * Linking different spatiotemporal scales e.g. combining thermal imagery with drones to characterise thermal landscapes more extensively, or developing correlative models to link subcanopy climate to remotely sensed temperature data e.g. LAI
* Chapter 5 emphasises that habitat fragmentation has had a huge impact on the structural potential for range shifts, so future conservation efforts should aim to deforest, reforest and protect forest with climate connectivity in mind
    * Particularly hot and cold spots of climate connectivity can be used to pursue this research area in finer detail, considering particular taxonomic groups and habitat types, and could use scenarios to forecast further changes to climate connectivity from changes in land use and land cover
    * Again, restoration and protection of degraded forests likely has a key role to play in achieving climate connectivity across the tropics, while improving conditions in other elements of the matrix may also help some species (although this is unlikely to be of net benefit if used in place of a land-sparing strategy)
    
## Conclusions

* The ways in which ongoing degradation and conversion of tropical forests impact the ability of species to respond to climate change will have a major influence on the long-term viability of forest specialists
* Tropical species represent a huge and vulnerable pool of global biodiversity, the loss of which would invariably push us towards, and perhaps beyond, various plantery boundaries
* We find that land-use change itself can have a major influence on climate at the level of the inidvidual, but note that degraded forests still provide opportunities for thermal buffering and therefore have value both now and under climate change
* Protection of degraded forests, perhaps combined with resoration on abandoned agricultural sites, may also help connect species to future climate analogues -- something that is clearly needed, since most tropical forests already fail to achieve climate connectivity
* In this context, the main aim of land managers should be to maximise the options available to species threatened with climate change, and so maintain climate resilience within changing tropical landscapes
