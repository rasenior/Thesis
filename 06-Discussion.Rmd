## Summary of thesis findings

* Aims of thesis were:
    1. Investigate the potential for land-use change to impact microclimates and microhabitats, and hence the subsequent impacts on:
        * The baseline of local climate change that global climate change is projected onto
        * The potential for thermal buffering as an adaptive response
    2. Investigate the potential for land-use change to impact range shifts under climate change

**Chapter 2 -- A pantropical analysis of the impacts of forest degradation and conversion on local temperature** 

** Main objectives:**
    1.
    2.
    3.
* Assessed how degradation and conversion of tropical forests directly impacts temperature on a fine spatiotemporal scale
* Implications for the impact of further warming under global climate change, but suggests that degraded forests and microhabitats may be able to buffer species from further change

**Chapter 3 -- A framework for quantifying fine-scale thermal heterogeneity in the field** 

** Main objectives:**
    1.
    2.
    3.
* Developed software and metrics for analysing thermal images
* Enables other researchers to more easily utilise thermography as a technique for researching thermal regimes, which are vitally important to species' ecology

**Chapter 4 -- Tropical forests are thermally buffered despite intensive selective logging** 
** Main objectives:**
    1.
    2.
    3.
* Compared fine-scale temperature in primary and selectively logged forests of Borneo, using field data collected with dataloggers and a thermal camera
* Found that despite clear structural differences between these forest types, there was very little temperature variation which suggests rapid thermal recovery and underscores the importance of logged forests for biodiversity both now and under future climate change

**Chapter 5 -- The impact of recent forest cover change on climate connectivity in the tropics**

** Main objectives:**
    1.
    2.
    3.
* Combined global tree cover and climate datasets to quantify, pantropically, the current physical potential for species to reach climate analogues through near-continuous forest, and the extent to which this has been affected by recent forest cover change
* Found that current levels of climate connectivity are generally very poor, particularly in lowland regions with low forest cover and on mountain summits, hence many tropical species will struggle to reach analogous climate given current levels of forest cover

## Climate at the fine scale

* Chapter 2 highlights that climate at the very coarse scale can mask important patterns occurring at a local scale
    * Land-use change has a direct impact on local climate
    * Suggestion that below-ground and within degraded forests species may avoid direct warming that results from loss of forest cover
    * Bias towards particular regions & LUT
    * Doesn't account for intensity
* Chapter 3 establishes a framework to assess thermal regimes at an even finer spatial scale, using thermography
    * Importance of very fine spatial scale
    * Importance of surface temperature
    * Importance of spatial temperature variation
* Chapter 4 applies the framework of Chapter 3, alongside traditional dataloggers cf. Chapter 2, to further explore the potential for thermal buffering in selectively logged forests of Borneo
    * Confirm that local temperature is unaffected by selective logging, but so too is the fine-scale temperature variation that is vital for thermal buffering by animasls
* Neither approach considered other climatic variables that are important to species' ecology under climate change (e.g. water & wind)
* Should also consider the vertical climate gradient in tropical rainforest [@scheffers_tropical_2018; @scheffers_vertical_2017]

## Climate at the coarse scale

* Fine-scale climate is important for the day-to-day, individual-level responses of organisms to suboptimal temperatures, but over decades it is highly likely that many species will respond to coarse-scale climate change by shifting their ranges
    * This could happen alongside in situ adaptation, which could provide a buffer and allow more time for species to reach new target habitat
    * It could also be that in situ adaptation is not possible or is insufficient, for example in converted lands where the local temperature has increased to a level way beyond the thermal tolerance of forest specialists
* Chapter 4 considers the extent to which land-use change impacts landscape permeability, and the subsequent potential for species to reach analogous climates through natural habitat
    * Current levels of forest cover in the tropics offer poor connectivity between analogous climates, which has largely worsened from 2000 to 2012
* Only considering structural connectivity - no species data (this would make the approach species-specific and impose data limitations)
* Do not consider other climate variables, because their projections are uncertain and spatially variable, which makes it impossible at this stage to determine the gradient that species would have to follow to maintain climate parity

## Wider applicability of findings

### Biological relevance

* Chapters 2-4 are most relevant to small-bodied ectotherms, that are heavily influenced by local and fine-scale temperature and which are widely known to utilise thermal variation at this scale as a means to avoid suboptimal climatic conditions at a coarser scale
    * Also relevant to small-bodied endotherms, although less is known about the extent to which they can and do utilise microclimates in tropical forests
    * Could be relevant to plants, particuarly in early life stages e.g. germination
    * A need to consider how behavioural exploitation of fine-scale temperature variation interacts with local adaptation and acclimation, and coarser scale responses such as range shifts
* Chapter 5 is more relevant to larger and more mobile animal species, such as medium-sized mammals, which are perhaps less able to adapt in situ but likely to shift their ranges in response to climate change
    * Relevance to plants will also depend on ability to disperse across matrix
    * Unknowns about how forest itself will shift under climate change also influences the relevance of these results to forest specialists
    * Different kinds of forest, which will limit different species to differeng extents
    * Inclusion of tree plantations may not be appropriate for many forest specialists, since they tend to lack structural and biological diversity 
    
### Relevance across tropics

* Chapter 2 was pantropical, but Africa was poorly represented 
    * Where natural vegetation is not forest (e.g. par√°mo, cerrado, savannah, dessert), it is expected that land-use change will have a much less substantial impact on local temperature
* Chapter 4 focused on a region of the tropics where logging intensity has in the past been very severe, but where logging activity has since ceased
    * Less relevant to areas with ongoing intensive logging
    * Less relevant to areas where recovery of canopy cover has not been permitted or not possible
* Chapter 4 only focused on the understorey, but in vertically complex forests there may well me a different result above the understorey

## Recommendations for conservation and futher research

* Land-use change is still a primary cause of species loss, and the lack of consideration of climatic impacts of land-use change may have underestimated this impact or caused it to be confounded with climate change (Chapter 2)
* Growing literature on the ways in which land-use change and climate change interact, but the impacts on risk of extinction for particular species will depend on many factors:
    * Spatiotemporal scale (Chapter 3 and 4)
    * Plasticity
    * Local adaptation
    * Functional connectivity (e.g. dispersal limits, metapopulation dynamics)
* On a local scale, enhancing thermal heterogeneity may help species to thermoregulate and so buffer species from climate change (at least offering them more time to adpat or disperse)
    * Chapter 4 suggests that natural resoration over a decade is sufficient for thermal recovery in the understorey, but this should be integrated with recovery of other abiotic and biotic requirements
    * More research is needed on the speed of thermal recovery, and whether active restoration or RIL techniques might have a role to play in enhancing thermal recovery from logging
    * What about other forms of land-use change?
* With improvements in technology, it would be fruitful to consider: 
    * Other climatic factors, particularly moisture, at a fine spatial scale
    * Linking different spatiotemporal scales e.g. combining thermal imagery with drones to characterise thermal landscapes more extensively, or developing correlative models to link subcanopy climate to remotely sensed temperature data e.g. LAI
* Chapter 5 emphasises that habitat fragmentation has had a huge impact on the structural potential for range shifts, so future conservation efforts should aim to deforest, reforest and protect forest with climate connectivity in mind
    * Particularly hot and cold spots of climate connectivity can be used to pursue this research area in finer detail, considering particular taxonomic groups and habitat types, and could use scenarios to forecast further changes to climate connectivity from changes in land use and land cover
    * Again, restoration and protection of degraded forests likely has a key role to play in achieving climate connectivity across the tropics, while improving conditions in other elements of the matrix may also help some species (although this is unlikely to be of net benefit if used in place of a land-sparing strategy)
    
## Conclusions

* The ways in which ongoing degradation and conversion of tropical forests impact the ability of species to respond to climate change will have a major influence on the long-term viability of forest specialists
* Tropical species represent a huge and vulnerable pool of global biodiversity, the loss of which would invariably push us towards, and perhaps beyond, various plantery boundaries
* We find that land-use change itself can have a major influence on climate at the level of the inidvidual, but note that degraded forests still provide opportunities for thermal buffering and therefore have value both now and under climate change
* Protection of degraded forests, perhaps combined with resoration on abandoned agricultural sites, may also help connect species to future climate analogues -- something that is clearly needed, since most tropical forests already fail to achieve climate connectivity
* In this context, the main aim of land managers should be to maximise the options available to species threatened with climate change, and so maintain climate resilience within changing tropical landscapes
