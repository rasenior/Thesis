## Summary

The conservation of biodiversity globally depends in large part on the conservation of tropical biodiversity. The biggest single driver of biodiversity loss is land-use change [@sala_global_2000]. In the tropics, this is largely driven by continuing deforestation to meet global food demands [@gibbs_tropical_2010; @tilman_global_2011], alongside extensive degradation by direct disturbances such as selective logging and fire, as well as indirect, secondary impacts such as edge effects from fragmentation and increased access for poachers from expanding road networks [@barlow_anthropogenic_2016;  @haddad_habitat_2015; @laurance_impacts_2009]. Simultaneously, the intensifying and inexorable threat of climate change is likely to be felt keenly in the tropics [@corlett_impacts_2011]. Relative to the long periods of climatic stability that characterise this region, species' exposure to climate warming will be among the highest globally [@mora_projected_2013], combined with high sensitivity of tropical species because of their restricted thermal tolerance [@deutsch_impacts_2008; @tewksbury_putting_2008; @khaliq_global_2014] and limited capacity for dispersal or adaptation [@opdam_climate_2004; @loarie_velocity_2009; @moore_experimental_2008; @hoffmann_climate_2011]. A key unknown, addressed in this thesis, is the extent to which the loss and degradation of tropical forests might exacerbate biodiversity loss by impeding species' ability to adaptively respond to climate change.

The main aims of this thesis were to determine how land-use change in the tropics impacts (1) exposure to local warming, and the feasibility of both (2) microclimates and of (3) range shifts as mechanisms by which species can avoid extinction under global climate change. First, comparing local, site-level temperature in various different land-use types, I found that conversion of forest to farmland resulted in local warming of 1.6-13.6&deg;C, but this was avoided below-ground and in degraded forests. To further investigate the thermal buffering potential of degraded forests I developed a framework and `R` package, which together facilitate assessment of thermal heterogeneity using thermal images. Combining this approach with temperature dataloggers and microhabitat assessments, I found that the potential for thermal buffering was similar in intensively logged forest and nearby unlogged forests on Borneo, despite notable differences in forest structure. Even with thermal buffering the distribution of many species will shift as the climate warms, hence I used global forest cover and climate datasets to quantify, across the tropics, the extent to which range shifts to analogous future climates are facilitated by existing forest cover, and how this has changed with recent deforestation. I found that 62% of tropical forest area already fails to connect to future climate analogues, and this will likely deteriorate further as 27% of tropical experienced loss of climate connectivity from 2000 to 2012, accelerating with increasing forest loss. 

In the following chapter I synthesise all my results to illustrate how, overall, the loss and degradation of forests has impacted species' ability to respond to future climate change in the tropics. I conclude with recommendations for conservation practitioners and policy-makers, and some suggestions for priority research directions.

### Climate at the fine scale

Until recently most studies of climate change impacts used very coarse resolution climate data -- up to 10,000 times greater than the size of the study organism [@potter_microclimatic_2013] -- and did not well integrate the combined effects of land-use change and climate change [@titeux_global_2017]. The findings of [Chapter 2](#ch2) highlight that coarse-scale data can mask important anthropogenic impacts at the level of the organism. Namely, that in many parts of the tropics where forest has been lost, extreme warming has already occurred as a result. Degraded forests and below-ground habitat avoided local warming through land-use change, although [Chapter 2](#ch2) did not consider temperature at the micro-scale (mm to m; 'microclimates') that allows mobile organisms to behaviourally thermoregulate [@scheffers_microhabitats_2014; @gonzalez_del_pliego_thermally_2016], and can even influence fine-scale distribution of less mobile organisms [@maclean_fine-scale_2017]. 

Capturing micro-scale, biologically-relevant temperature data has become increasingly feasible with the advent of small dataloggers and affordable thermal imaging technology [@scheffers_extreme_2017]. The latter has, however, been underutilised at least in part because there is little guidance available for processing and analysing thermal images in ecology. I addressed this shortfall in [Chapter 3](#ch3), where I presented an `R` package -- `ThermStats` -- designed to streamline the processing of images from FLIR thermal cameras, and to calculate key metrics of thermal heterogeneity for any gridded temperature data. 

In [Chapter 4](#ch4) I built on the findings of [Chapter 2](#ch2) by assessing microclimate availability and buffering capacity in intensively selected logged forests on Borneo, in comparison with nearby unlogged, primary forest. Using techniques developed in [Chapter 3](#ch3), combined with data from temperature loggers and microhabitat measurements, I found that not only are degraded forests and primary forests comparable in local temperature (cf. [Chapter 2](#ch2)), but microclimates are similar in availability, thermal stability and ability to buffer organisms from warming at coarser spatial scales. 

### Climate at the coarse scale

Chapters 2 to 4 focused on the impact of land-use change on temperature at spatial scales of millimetres to hectares, which, in the context of climate change, is important for understanding the baseline temperature onto which global climate warming is projected, as well as the likely ability of organisms to utilise microclimates as a means to avoid suboptimal temperatures experienced at coarser spatial scales. However, even where microrefugia are available, and especially where they are not, global climate change could impact temperature at all spatial scales to the extent that organisms will need longer-term solutions to avoid extinction [@hannah_fine-grain_2014]. Range shifts are one such solution, and have been widely documented [@parmesan_ecological_2006]. In [Chapter 5](#ch5) I found that tropical forests are generally poorly connected along climate gradients, such that the average tropical forest will fail to facilitate species' range shifts to analogous future climates. Increasing loss of forest resulted in an accelerating loss of climate connectivity, suggesting that without intervention the current situation could decline rapidly.  

## Wider applicability of findings

### Biological relevance

The results of Chapters 2 to 4 are most relevant for small-bodied ectotherms, which are strongly influenced by local and fine-scale temperature, and are widely known to utilise thermal variation at these spatial scales to avoid suboptimal climatic conditions at coarser scales [@scheffers_microhabitats_2014; @gonzalez_del_pliego_thermally_2016]. Small-bodied animals are more strongly influenced by surface temperatures and boundary layer climates [e.g. @kaspari_thermal_2015] so our results are also relevant for small-bodied endotherms, although less is known about the extent to which they can and do utilise microclimates in tropical rainforests. While immobile species cannot directly utilise microclimates within generations, their fitness may still be affected by local temperature and by changes in fine-scale thermal heterogeneity, the latter potentially driving dispersal between generations and causing individuals to localise within particular microclimates [@maclean_microclimates_2015]. 

The findings of [Chapter 5](#ch5) are most immediately relevant for species that can disperse easily but require forest cover to do so, such as medium to large-sized, non-volant forest specialists [cf. @nunez_connectivity_2013]. The size of these organisms makes microclimates a less viable way to avoid climate warming in the long term, but also enhances their ability to disperse to more favourable climates. Poorer dispersers may be unable to keep pace with changing climate [@schloss_dispersal_2012], requiring additional mechanisms to avoid extinction such as microrefugia or physiological plasticity.

A key consideration for future research is water balance. Moist habitats are more robust to temperature change because water has a higher specific heat capacity than air, requiring a greater input of thermal energy to achieve the same change in temperature. Increased water availability in forests also increases evapotranspiration, meaning that thermal energy is dissipated through the evaporation of water rather than a change in temperature [@oke_boundary_1987]. Additionally, water can determine species' sensitivity to temperature change. Amphibians, for example, have a semi-permeable skin and are prone to dessication in hot environments if water availability is low [@duellman_biology_1986]. A particularly useful metric is vapour pressure deficit -- the difference between the amount of moisture in the air and how much moisture the air can hold when it is saturated -- which can be measured at fine spatial scales using dataloggers that record both temperature and relative humidity. These dataloggers are prone to water damage [@bramer_advances_2018], but could provide valuable information for quantifying microclimates. The influence of water in shaping species' climate niche may also influence species' range shifts in a warming world. Precipitation data could provide a valuable extension to the approach of [Chapter 5](#ch5), although this is best applied at regional scale where future projections are more reliable and there is a clearer gradient that species would need to follow to avoid deleterious changes in precipitation. 

Regardless of spatial scale, in this thesis I have only focused on species movement in two dimensions. In reality, tropical rainforests have a high degree of structural complexity in the third dimension, providing an additional climate gradient that species could exploit to cope with global climate warming [@scheffers_tropical_2018; @scheffers_vertical_2017]. With ever-improving technology, it is possible to apply the techniques of [Chapter 3](#ch3) and [Chapter 4](#ch4) vertically and in forests of varying human impact to create a fuller, more three-dimensional picture of how human activity affects thermal regimes in tropical forests. Thermal data could be collected more extensively using LiDAR [@jucker_topography_2018], by combining thermal imagery with unmanned aerial vehicles [@faye_toolbox_2016; @sanchez-azofeifa_twenty-first_2017], and by combining telemetry and dataloggers to record and recreate the thermal experiences of large, mobile species. Detailed ground-truthed data could be combined with with above-canopy, remotely sensed data in correlative or mechanistic models [cf. @maclean_fine-scale_2017; @kearney_nichemapr_2017] to create sub-canopy climate layers, which could feed into Species Distribution Models or help us to understand other responses to climate change, such as local adaptation and acclimation.

### Relevance across tropics and elsewhere

Chapters 2 and 5 had the broadest geographical relevance, since they were pan-tropical in scope. The representativeness of [Chapter 2](#ch2) was limited by the availability of temperature data in the literature, with Africa being particularly poorly represented. This is a problem noted in other large-scale ecological studies [e.g. @gibson_primary_2011; @spooner_rapid_2018], and could compromise the generality of results because of the unique land-use history [@hansen_humid_2008] and biogeography of Africa. [Chapter 4](#ch4) focused on a region of the tropics where logging intensity was once among the highest globally [@lewis_increasing_2015] but has since ceased entirely [@reynolds_changes_2011]. Field studies such as this are inevitably site-specific, but combined with the framework of [Chapter 3](#ch3) and technological advances described above, the approach could be applied more extensively, for different modes of land-use change and of varying intensity and periods of recovery. Similarly, [Chapter 5](#ch5) considered only the effects of wholesale forest conversion because of limitations in the forest cover data available [@hansen_high-resolution_2013]. Techniques to remotely sense the age, quality and type of forest are still in development [@mitchell_current_2017], but could in time allow a much more nuanced assessment of climate connectivity across heterogenous forest landscapes.

This thesis focuses on tropical rainforests, but there are many priority regions for tropical conservation where natural vegetation is not closed canopy forest -- for example, Brazil's cerrado and the Succulent Karoo of South Africa and Namibia [@myers_biodiversity_2000]. In these places, modification by humans is less likely to dramatically alter local and fine-scale temperature because there is naturally less thermal buffering by complex, three-dimensional vegetation. However, that is not to say that a small change in absolute temperature would not have ecological implications; this depends on the ecology of inhabitant species and their sensitivity to temperature change. The specific structures associated with microclimates will undoubtedly also vary by location, e.g. desert burrows and alpine boulder fields [@shoo_potential_2010]. Climate connectivity is likely to be poor for many habitat types because of widespread habitat loss and resulting fragmentation. More intact regions tend to be those that are inhospitable to humans, such as taiga and deserts [@watson_catastrophic_2016] and regions at very high elevation [@elsen_global_2018]. In these places, climate connectivity will be largely determined by the availability of analogous future climate, and this is more likely in areas of high topographic complexity [@elsen_global_2018].

## Recommendations for conservation

Land-use change is still the primary cause of species loss [@sala_global_2000], and the lack of consideration of associated climatic effects suggests that its full impact may be underestimated and potentially confounded with climate change [[Chapter 2](#ch2); @senior_pantropical_2017;@oliver_interactions_2014]. As a growing driver of biodiversity loss, it is necessary to consider climate change and mitigate against it, but the priority for conservation research, practice and policy should -- first and foremost -- be to minimise land-use change and its negative consequences. A growing body of evidence suggests that a land sparing approach is often the best way to maximise biodiversity retention, whether the land use is agriculture [@phalan_reconciling_2011], selective logging [@edwards_land-sparing_2015] or urban development [@collas_urban_2017]. Payments for ecosystem services schemes, such as REDD+, could be used to incentivise forest protection and restoration in exchange for the maintenance of services such as carbon storage and water regulation.

On a local scale, enhancing thermal heterogeneity could increase the potential for thermal buffering, protecting species from climate change or, at the very least, providing more time for adaptation and dispersal [@hannah_fine-grain_2014]. [Chapter 4](#ch4) demonstrates that forest regeneration over a decade is sufficient for thermal recovery in the forest understorey after intensive selective logging. More research is needed to identify minimum recovery time, but it may be that active restoration or reduced impact logging cold bolster thermal recovery even further. One possible approach is *in situ* management of microrefugia, reviewed in @greenwood_using_2016. It would be insightful to experiment with such interventions in different land-use types in the tropics, assessing impacts on fine-scale thermal heterogeneity using dataloggers or thermal imagery (cf. Chapters 3 and 4), as well as the impact on local biodiversity. 

Given the potential value of logged tropical forests for buffering species against climate change ([Chapter 4](#ch4)), with the already well-established role of degraded forests in retaining species of conservation concern [@edwards_degraded_2011;@gibson_primary_2011; @putz_sustaining_2012], it is critical that they too are incorporated into conservation planning. Without protection, logged forests are susceptible to over-harvesting as well as edge effects, fire, hunting and wildlife trade associated with the expanding networks of roads and skid trails [@edwards_maintaining_2014; @laurance_global_2014]. With increasing forest degradation there is heightened risk of 'salvage' logging and, ultimately, conversion to agriculture [@edwards_maintaining_2014]. By managing forests designated for logging within larger, permanent timber estates, care can be taken to rotate cutting and allow for regeneration post-harvest, to implement reduced-impact logging techniques [@putz_reduced-impact_2008] and to ensure that mature forest is set-aside within the landscape to seed recovering sites and to provide habitat for disturbance-intolerant species [@edwards_maintaining_2014; @edwards_land-sharing_2014]. Sustainable timber harvesting can be promoted again through schemes such as REDD+, as well as through government regulations and market-based incentives from positive publicity to certification schemes, such as through the Forest Stewardship Council [@edwards_maintaining_2014; @edwards_land-sharing_2014].

[Chapter 5](#ch5) outlined the importance of connecting tropical forest along climate gradients to facilitate species range shifts under future climate change. Reforestation is in line with the Bonn Challenge, which seeks to restore 350 million hectares by 2030, while expanding the protected area network would contribute to Aichi target 11, whereby at least 17% of terrestrial and inland water areas are protected by 2020 [@cbd_strategic_2010]. A simple way to connect forest along climate gradients is to focus on elevational gradients, which are currently poorly connected [@elsen_global_2018]. This could have the additional benefit of conserving regions of topographic complexity and their associated microclimates, thus maximising species' options for responding to climate change [@suggitt_extinction_2018]. The results in [Chapter 5](#ch5) can be used to signpost to centres of poor climate connectivity, which would benefit from more targeted research at finer spatial resolutions, and tailored towards priority habitat types or taxa. Where it is not possible to connect current distributions to future climate analogues, well-planned translocation of poor dispersers can be a worthwhile and cost-effective solution to help imperilled species cope with climate warming [@willis_assisted_2009].
    
## Conclusions

The influence of ongoing degradation and conversion of tropical forests on the ability of species to respond to climate change will have a major bearing on long-term prospects for tropical forest specialists. Tropical species represent a large, valuable and vulnerable pool of global biodiversity, the loss of which would invariably push us towards, and perhaps beyond, various planetary boundaries. Land-use change can directly and substantially alter local climate, but degraded forests and microhabitats are valuable assets to conservation through their ability to buffer species from climate warming. Forest protection and restoration can also help connect species to future climate analogues, which most tropical forests currently fail to do. To maximise climate resilience of tropical rainforests, practitioners and policy-makers should maximise the options available for species to respond to climate: minimising forest loss, permitting and facilitating the recovery of degraded forests, and planning forest loss, gain and restoration with climate gradients and connectivity in mind.
