## Abstract

To survive in a warming world the range of many species will shift polewards or upwards. Tropical rainforests harbour most of the world's remaining terrestrial biodiversity, included many thermally restricted forest specialists. Despite this, we currently lack a biome-wide assessment of the potential for tropical species to reach climate analogues within existing forest cover. Moreover, no study to date has empirically tested where, how and why climate connectivity has changed as a result of change in forest cover. In this study, we quantified pantropical climate connectivity in 2000 and 2012. We tested various hypotheses relating climate connectivity change to the magnitude and location of forest cover change. We found that... To conserve global biodiversity under climate change, we suggest that unavoidable forest loss in the tropics should be..., and that forest protection and reforestation should... 

## Introduction

To avoid extinction under future climate change, species must either adapt *in situ* or shift their range [@hobbs_movers_2018]. Both strategies have been widely studied, with range shifts polewards or upwards appearing to be a widespread response to climate change across the globe, in both palaeoecological records and under modern climate change [@parmesan_ecological_2006; @davis_range_2001], and across a range of taxa [@chen_elevation_2009; @freeman_rapid_2014; @raxworthy_extinction_2008]. There is potential for other human impacts, including land-use change, to influence the ability of species to shift their ranges in response to climate change. Understanding such interactions is a conservation priority [@brook_synergies_2008; @mantyka-pringle_interactions_2012; @sirami_impacts_2017; @titeux_global_2017].

Land-use change impedes range shifts in most cases, by creating highly fragmented landscapes through which many species struggle to navigate [@thomas_extinction_2004; @heller_biodiversity_2009; @tucker_moving_2018]. The tropics is an area of particular concern because it harbours most remaining terrestrial biodiversity [@jenkins_global_2013] while also being the focus of intensive and extensive land-use change via the conversion and degradation of tropical forests [@hansen_high-resolution_2013; @lewis_increasing_2015]. Although the absolute magnitude of climate change will be greatest at the poles [@ipcc_climate_2013], long periods of climatic stability mean that is the tropics where relative climate change will be the most severe [@mora_projected_2013]. Many tropical species have limited tolerance for temperature change [@deutsch_impacts_2008; @tewksbury_putting_2008; @khaliq_global_2014], and are also highly sensitive to fragmentation because of habitat specialism and poor dispersal ability [@opdam_climate_2004]. Climate-driven range shifts in the tropics generally follow elevation al gradients, probably because latitudinal temperature gradients are very shallow [@loarie_velocity_2009]. Range shifts of tropical species have been documented in response to as little warming as 0.1&deg;C to 0.76&deg;C [@parmesan_globally_2003; @raxworthy_extinction_2008; @chen_elevation_2009; @peh_potential_2007; @freeman_rapid_2014; @raxworthy_extinction_2008].

The ability of species to shift their ranges in response to climate change depends both on the future availability of suitable habitat with an analogous climate, and the connectivity between the species' current distribution and any potential future habitat. Species Distribution Models (SDMs) have been key in addressing the former, using the correlation between current distribution and current abiotic conditions (including climate) to forecast where species might go in the future [@hijmans_ability_2006]. However, not only do SDMs fail to consider connectivity, they are also fine-filter approaches focusing on specific species and requiring a wealth of data relating to the distribution of those species [@nunez_connectivity_2013]. Equally, there is a plethora of studies that quantify habitat connectivity -- both structural and actual connectivity [@calabrese_comparison-shoppers_2004] -- which have been instrumental in highlighting the extent of fragmentation by land-use change [e.g. @tucker_moving_2018; @brodie_evaluating_2015; @cosgrove_consequences_2017]. These studies, however, do not explicitly consider climate. This is important because large areas of structurally connected habitat could still become unsuitable under climate change if there is insufficient climatic heterogeneity within that habitat (e.g. lowland rainforest). 

The handful of studies that do integrate habitat connectivity with climate are highly informative both for quantifying the current connectedness of natural areas to future climate analogues, and for predicting specific movement routes or 'climate corridors' between source and target areas [@mcguire_achieving_2016; @littlefield_connecting_2017; @nunez_connectivity_2013]. Such corridors could prove vital for many range-shifting species. That said, 'climate connectivity', defined as the extent to which "spatial configuration of natural lands allows species to track their current climatic conditions during projected climate change" [@mcguire_achieving_2016], has yet to be reviewed for a whole biome, nor has any study to date utilised empirical data to examine the change in climate connectivity over time. The latter is significant if we are to understand the factors that drive change in climate connectivity: where does an increase in natural habitat maximise climate connectivity, and where does loss of natural habitat minimise loss of climate connectivity?

In this study, we combined current and future climate data with data from tropical land-use change that has already occurred, to quantify both the current climate connectivity across the tropics and the patterns of climate connectivity change in the recent past. To enable a broad, coarse-filter assessment of climate connectivity, we consider land use only in terms of forest versus non-forest, using 2000 and 2012 tree cover data from @hansen_high-resolution_2013 and excluding tree plantations [@transparent_world_tree_2015]. Climate connectivity was quantified by adapting the approach of @mcguire_achieving_2016: forested areas were categorised into patches according to 0.5&deg;C increments in Mean Annual Temperature [@hijmans_very_2005], and for each patch we calculated the coolest destination patch that could be reached by traversing a gradient from hotter to cooler adjacent patches. Patches achieved climate connectivity if they were able to reach a destination with a future temperature cooler than or equal to its current temperature. The aim of this approach is to quantify only the physical potential for thermally-restricted tropical forest species to reach climate analogues via forested habitat; it does not take into account any species-specific restrictions such as dispersal distance. We hypothesised that forest cover change from 2000 to 2012, elevation and  the geometry of forest patches (patch area) would explain much of the variation in climate connectivity.  

## Materials and Methods

We focused our study on the pantropics, including all land masses located between &plusmn;23.43694&deg; latitude and more than 65,610 km^2^ in area [*this is to reduce computational load and focus on places where range shifts are likely to be most feasible - it's currently arbitrarily set as the area of Sri Lanka*]. Maps were analysed at 1-km resolution projected into the World Cylindrical Equal Area projection. All spatial layers were processed with Python code implemented using the arcpy module in ArcMap version 10.4.1 [@esri_arcgis]. 

### Climate-partitioned forest patches

Since we were interested in climate connectivity for tropical forest specialists, we calculated climate connectivity based on movement along a temperature gradient within forested areas only. We defined regions as forest or non-forest using tree cover data from @hansen_high-resolution_2013. For the year 2000 (the recent past) cells were defined as forested if they had > 50% tree cover [@hansen_high-resolution_2013], and did not fall within the boundaries of tree plantations [@transparent_world_tree_2015]. For the year 2012 (present day), cells were classed as forest based on forest loss and forest gain [@hansen_high-resolution_2013] relative to the forest cover in 2000. If a cell had experienced forest loss from 2000 to 2012, it had gone from a forested to non-forested state and the cell was classed as non-forest. Conversely, if a cell had experienced forest gain from 2000 to 2012, it had gone from a non-forested to forested state; providing there had been no loss and the cell was not within a tree plantation, the cell was classed as forest. 

Based on the approach of @mcguire_achieving_2016, we partitioned forest patches using a present-day (~1950-2000), 30-arc-second global layer for Mean Annual Temperature (hereafter: temperature) from the WorldClim database [Version 1.4; @hijmans_very_2005], resampled to 1 km^2^. The same approach was applied separately to 2000 forest cover and 2012 forest cover: temperature values were assigned to forested cells and reclassified to increments of 0.5&deg;C, based on evidence that tropical species are sensitive to this degree of temperature difference [e.g. @peh_potential_2007; @freeman_rapid_2014; @raxworthy_extinction_2008]. The resulting raster was then converted to polygons, whereby neighbouring forest cells with the same temperature value were assigned to the same polygon (hereafter: forest patch). While our approach is not specific to any particular taxon, it may be helpful to consider it in the context of range shifts by non-volant terrestrial animals [cf. @nunez_connectivity_2013]. We removed forest patches < 10 km^2^ in area, based on the assumption that they could not support a population for long enough to enable range shifts [REF]. Patches within 2 km of each other were assigned to the same patch, assuming that populations could move across 2 km of non-forest to reach suitable habitat [REF].

### Climate connectivity

The logic behind the measure of climate connectivity in @mcguire_achieving_2016 is that it represents the maximum temperature differential between current and future conditions that can be achieved by traversing a gradient of hotter to cooler patches within existing forest cover. We assigned mean current and future temperature to all forest patches, again using data from WorldClim. Future temperature was for the year 2050 (2041-2060), derived from the HadGEM2-AO general circulation model [@ipcc_climate_2013] and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, which is the most severe ('business-as-usual') IPCC scenario. 

To trace each forest patch to its final destination patch we identified which patches were neighbours, and - for each neighbour pair - defined the hotter patch as the origin and the cooler patch as the destination. Most patches will have multiple neighbours, creating a network of connected patches with many possible pathways between them. We iterated over each unique temperature from cooler to hotter, propagating cool temperatures backward through the network of connected patches to identify the coolest temperature that could be reach for each origin patch [see Supplementary Text 1 for a worked example; @mcguire_achieving_2016].

Once each origin patch has a designated final destination patch, climate connectivity is calculated from the temperature differential between them. The key question is whether forest cover is sufficient for organisms to reach a place that, under future climate warming, is the same as or cooler than the temperature where it currently resides. Thus, climate connectivity is simply current temperature of the origin patch minus the future temperature of the destination patch. Where this value is zero or positive, the patch has achieved climate connectivity: there is sufficient structural connectivity between forested areas for organisms to reach an analogous future climate.

Climate connectivity was necessarily calculated at a patch-level, independently, for 2000 and 2012. However, because patches themselves were not constant through time, we used median climate connectivity within 50 m elevation al bands as our response variable. This not only enables comparison between the years, but also captures the potential interacting effect of elevation. Most human development occurs at lower elevations and most tropical species will likely track temperature gradients by moving uphill [@loarie_velocity_2009], therefore both the patterns and significance of climate connectivity are likely to vary according to elevation. Elevation was derived from NASA's SRTM 90m Digital Elevation Database v4.1 [@nasa_srtm_2008].

### Statistical analyses

All data were analysed using linear models in R version 3.4.3 [@r_core_team_2017]. To understand current patterns we modelled 2012 climate connectivity against both elevation and continent. Any continental differences in climate connectivity are important from a policy perspective, but may also be expected owing to the different biogeography and land-use history of each continent within the pantropics: North and South America (hereafter: Latin America), Africa, Asia and Australia.

We hypothesised that the key drivers of change in climate connectivity would be change in forest cover and the geometry of forest patches in the year 2000. Within the same elevation al bands used to define climate connectivity, we calculated median patch area (km^2^) in the year 2000 (henceforth: patch area) and the total number of cells that went from a forested to non-forested state between 2000 and 2012 (henceforth: forest loss). In the full model, we tested change in climate connectivity against elevation and forest loss (and the interaction between them), and against patch area. 

## Results

### Current state of climate connectivity

Across the whole study area, climate connectivity in 2012 ranged from a minimum of ??&deg;C to a maximum of ??&deg;C, with a median value of??&deg;C. Only ??% of the total area of forest patches achieved successful climate connectivity, with a value more than or equal to zero (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-1)). Climate connectivity differed substantially by elevation band (F = ??; P = ??), initially decreasing sharply as elevation increased, before reaching a plateau of around -3&deg;C at elevations of 100 m or more (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-2)).

### Change in climate connectivity

Many areas experienced no change in climate connectivity from 2000 to 2012 (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-3)), although change ranged from ??&deg;C to +??&deg;C. Forest loss was widespread, with a total area of ?? km^2^ deforested between 2000 and 2012 (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-4)). 

Change in climate connectivity over time was unaffected by the area of forest patches in the year 2000 (F = ??; P = ??), but decreased with increasing forest loss (F = ??; P = ??; Figure \@ref(fig:fig-5)).

## Discussion

* We quantify for the first time the state of climate connectivity across the tropics, and how it has changed over a 12-year period. 
* We make use of global datasets to empirically test factors that influence the probability of forest gaining or losing climate connectivity, such as the magnitude of forest cover change and elevation.
* _Interpretation of predictors of climate connectivity and change in climate connectivity, and what this means for biodiversity._
* Quantifying and understanding climate connectivity in the tropics is important for estimating the potential for thermally-restricted forest specialists to adaptively respond to climate change. Such species represent a large proportion of the world's total biodiversity, but are highly threatened and highly vulnerable.

### Caveats and limitations

It is important to note that we are not quantifying climate connectivity for particular species. This study is focused on how land-use change and climate change will interact to affect groups of species with particular thermal requirements. As such, our protocol analyses how forest cover and forest cover change affects the physical connectedness of forest patches within a particular climatic niche [cf. @mcguire_achieving_2016]. The measure of climate connectivity is essentially a measure of the potential for thermally-restricted groups of species to track their preferred climate through near-continuous forest cover; we do not suggest that this alone is sufficient to predict the likelihood that such species will be capable of avoiding extinction under climate change. Many other factors will affect both the need and capacity for species to shift their ranges in response to rising temperatures. For example, even thermally-restricted species can adapt *in situ* via phenotypic plasticity, genetic adaptation or exploitation of climate refugia [@parmesan_ecological_2006; @hannah_fine-grain_2014]. Species-specific factors such as dispersal limits could preclude species from tracking their preferred climate even where climate connectivity exists, while some species may be capable of traversing greater distances through non-forest than we have allowed in our approach. 

We focus on Mean Annual Temperature to create climate-partitioned forest patches, but note that other climate variables -- particularly precipitation -- are also extremely important in determining the climatic niche of any given species. Unfortunately, projections of future precipitation under climate change remain highly uncertain [@ipcc_climate_2013; @corlett_climate_2012], and are also highly variable in space, both of which make it unclear the gradient that species would have to follow to avoid deleterious changes in precipitation. 

The breadth of our study enabled us to determine broad trends and patterns across the most biodiverse biome in the terrestrial realm. However, to achieve such breadth requires that assumptions and simplifications are made. Our results should not be used to infer regional and local climate connectivity directly, but rather as a signpost to locations that appear to deviate from trends at a pantropical scale, and would therefore benefit from further, targeted investigation at a finer spatial scale, potentially incorporating species-specific information appropriate to the questions of interest [e.g. @martensen_spatio-temporal_2017]. Violations of our assumptions in particular regions would, of course, render our estimates of climate connectivity less accurate in those places. Overall, however, our focus is on climate connectivity at a pantropical scale, and therefore regional discrepancies will likely have limited impact on our overall conclusions. Our study, along with other, similar studies [@mcguire_achieving_2016; @martensen_spatio-temporal_2017; @nunez_connectivity_2013], represents the first steps towards capturing the current state of climate connectivity, but inevitably these approaches will be greatly enhanced by continuing developments in computational power and global, remotely-sensed datasets [@sanchez-azofeifa_twenty-first_2017].

### Summary

Assessing the current status of climate connectivity across a whole biome enables us to establish a baseline, against which we can better appreciate the current and future threats to global biodiversity from the combined influence of land-use change and climate change. By using empirical data to characterise where, how and why forest cover change impacts climate connectivity, we can ensure that landscape planning of future, unavoidable forest loss is done with climate resilience in mind. Similarly, we can plan for forest gain (i.e. reforestation) and forest protection (e.g. Protected Areas) that incorporates and enhances climate corridors.
