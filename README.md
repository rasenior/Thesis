# The impacts of tropical forest degradation and conversion on resilience to climate change

Code and files to create my PhD thesis using bookdown.

The thesis considers how degradation and conversion of tropical forests has impacted the ability of species to adaptively respond to climate change. [My research](http://www.edwardslab.group.shef.ac.uk/rebecca_senior/) was based at the University of Sheffield. My supervisors were: Dr David Edwards ([University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/aps/staff-and-students/acadstaff/edwards)) and Prof Jane Hill ([University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/research/ecology-evolution/kane-k-hill/)).
