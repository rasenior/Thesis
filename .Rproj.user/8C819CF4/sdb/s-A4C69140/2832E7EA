Impact of unbalanced sampling {-}\n\n### Methods {-}\n\nSome studies contributed substantially more temperature observations than others. To test whether these studies were unduly influencing our results, we established a threshold over which a given land-use type, in a given study, was deemed to have a disproportionate number of associated temperature observations. The threshold used – 2,071 observations – was the mean number of observations across all unique combinations of land-use type and study identity (55 in total). The same number of observations (2,071) was then randomly re-sampled from each of the land-use type and study combinations that exceeded the threshold. With this reduced and more balanced dataset we repeated the main analysis (see 'Statistical analysis' in main text for more details), modelling local day-time temperature ('temp_day') against land-use type ('LUT'), position relative to ground-level ('position') and season. The final model structure was unchanged, and included a random slope for land-use type and random intercept with respect to the identity of the study ('studyID') from which data originated:\n\n`lmer(temp_day  ~ LUT*position + LUT*season + (LUT|studyID))`\n\n### Results {-}\n\nAll results were qualitatively unchanged from those derived using the full dataset. Local day-time temperature was warmer in altered land-use types, compared to primary forest (LMM, `r \"\\U03A7\"`^2^ = 32.19, df = 4, P < 0.001; Fig. S3). Averaged across above- and below-ground, and across seasons, the temperature differential was greatest in cropland (7.7&deg;C), followed by pasture (6.4&deg;C), plantation (3.2&deg;C) and degraded forest (0.9&deg;C).\nThe relationship between land-use type and temperature interacted with both position relative to ground level (LMM, `r \"\\U03A7\"`^2^ = 681, df = 4, P < 0.001; Fig. S3A) and season (LMM, `r \"\\U03A7\"`^2^ = 105.63, df = 4, P < 0.001; Fig. S3B). Specifically, the difference between altered land-use types and primary forest was greater above-ground than below-ground (Fig. S3A), and variable between seasons according to the land-use type (Fig. S3B).\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n## Appendix 1B.
